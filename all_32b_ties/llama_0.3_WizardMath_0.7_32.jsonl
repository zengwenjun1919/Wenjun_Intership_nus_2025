Here are 10 great tips for making the most out of drum lessons:\n1. Start with the basics: When teaching kids about drumming, it's important to start with the basics. This includes learning about the different parts of the drum set, how to hold the sticks correctly, and how to play basic rhythms.\n2. Make it fun: Drumming can be a fun and exciting experience for kids. As a teacher, you should create a positive atmosphere that encourages creativity and experimentation. Use games and interactive activities to make the lessons more engaging.\n3. Create a routine: Like any other skill, practicing drumming regularly can help kids improve their techniques and gain confidence. Encourage your students to practice at home and set up a routine that allows them to progress at their own pace.\n4. Praise and encouragement: Kids often need reminders that they are doing a good job. As their teacher, it's important to offer praise and encouragement when they make progress or try something new. This will help build their confidence and motivate them to continue learning.\n5. Listen to music: As someone who already knows and loves music, you can help your students explore different genres and styles. Listening to music can inspire kids to create their own beats and rhythms, and it can also help them understand the context of the music they are learning.\n6.

Break down complex rhythms: When teaching more advanced rhythms, it's important to break them down into smaller, more manageable parts.

Since then, some people have been criticizing the Cybertruck for not being as smooth as a traditional truck. However, we think the new vehicle is smooth in different ways. Here are five reasons we think the Tesla Cybertruck is the right direction.\nFirst, the Cybertruck has a unique, futuristic look that definitely sets it apart from other trucks on the road. This is a good thing because it will make people stop and take notice, which is important for a vehicle that runs on electricity. The Cybertruck's design also reinforces Tesla's commitment to sustainability and innovation, two values that are important to many consumers.\nSecond, the Cybertruck's lightweight chassis and body structure help reduce its weight, which in turn makes it more energy-efficient. This means that the Cybertruck will be able to travel farther on a single charge than other trucks.\nThird, the Cybertruck's aerodynamic design helps improve its fuel efficiency. This is another way that the vehicle's design plays a role in making it more sustainable.\nFourth, the Cybertruck's smooth lines and curves help reduce drag, which again improves fuel efficiency.\nFinally, the Cybertruck is designed with safety in mind. Its airbags and reinforced structure help protect the occupants in the event of a crash.\nOverall, we think that the Tesla Cybertruck is a smooth move in the right direction. It is a unique, sustainable, and energy-efficient vehicle that sets a high standard for future truck design. The Cybertruck's unique design may not be for everyone, but it is a step in the right direction for the automotive industry.\nPosted by Mike Zoe at 03:09 PM in Automotive, Sustainability | Permalink | Comments (0)\nTesla Cybertruck: The Next Step in the Evolution of the Truck\nThe Tesla Cybertruck was unveiled on November 21st, 2019, and it caused quite a stir. The truck's unique design and futuristic look were polarizing, to say the least. But what makes this truck special is not just its exterior, but its cutting-edge technology and features. Let's explore the Tesla Cybertruck in more detail.\nThe Tesla Cybertruck is based on the Tesla Model Y platform, a popular electric vehicle from Tesla. This means that the Cybertruck shares many of the same features as the Model Y, such as its powertrain, battery pack, and charging capabilities. The Cybertruck comes with either a 400-kilowatt-hour (kWh) battery pack or a 250 kWh battery pack, both of which can be charged up to 100 times.\nOne of the most unique features of the Cybertruck is its tri-motor drive system. This system consists of three independent motors, each of which can deliver up to 355 horsepower. This means that the Cybertruck can accelerate from 0 to 60 miles per hour (mph) in as little as 2.9 seconds. It can also reach a top speed of 130 mph. Additionally, the Cybertruck's advanced suspension system provides a smooth, comfortable ride even when driving at high speeds.\nThe Tesla Cybertruck also features some advanced safety technologies. These include electronic stability control, automatic emergency braking, and a 360-degree camera system.

She decides to take it but wants to wait 3 months until her dad's estate is settled. Then her mother is killed and Lily moves into the Blackwell Estate on Long Island. It's here she meets the Blackwell family and also meets Gabe. Lily becomes good friends with Nate and his daughter and also with Miles and his wife Emily.

I don't want to give anything away because I really think you should just go into this book knowing as little as possible. I think Sarah Alderson manages to create a real air of secrecy around the story as well as creating a cast of intriguing characters. Lily is a really good character too and I found it easy to connect with her. I think this book is a lot darker than some of the other books I've read by Sarah Alderson but I still really enjoyed it.

The book is set in a small town and opens with the death of Vivian 'Viva' Marlowe. At first the story is told from several different characters' point of view but after 38 chapters we meet Vivian, alive.\nThe story follows the Marlowes, two sets of twins and the people they come into contact with, in the 1980's and the present day. It's a bit of a slow burner to begin with as the characters gradually reveal themselves but once things pick up, and people start to connect with each other, it becomes more interesting.\nThere are some sweet moments but equally some more emotional ones. There were times when I questioned what the point of certain characters were and there are a couple who I still don't think are that important to the actual story. Once the pieces start to come together the mystery of what really happened to Vivian becomes clear but I still found myself a bit confused about the ending.\nOverall, I think this is a good book. It's not a book I would usually pick up but I'm glad I did. It's a bit long winded in places but I think if you can stick with it, it's a good read.\nLabels: 3 Star, Review, S, Siobhan Vivian\nGrace and Fury by Tracy Deonn - Review\nI had super high expectations going into this book as I was really looking forward to reading it.

I also found the family dynamic a little bit confusing at first because not only did I not know the characters, I also didn't know that much about fantasy so I was unsure about some of the powers and spells.\nHowever, once we hit a certain part in the book, it really picks up and things start to become clearer.

I know how much she's hated that it hasn't been taken off my TBR shelf. And it wasn't because of anything bad; it was because of something so darn good it had me stalled for a while.\nSo, now, without further ado, may I present:\nWhen I Say You're Beautiful by Stacy Wakefield\nLily Lewis is the only daughter of a prominent politician. She has grown up in the lap of luxury. She has never known a day of want or hardship. When Lily met Cameron, things started to change for her. She fell in love. After everything, he broke her heart when he left for another girl.\nA chance meeting with a young man named Aiden leaves Lily contemplating what her future life should be. She's not exactly sure what to think, so she does what every girl does. She thinks. A lot. She also starts to examine her relationship with her family. It's never been good. But for some reason, she thinks it might be time to take a step back and try to create a better dynamic.\nLily's relationships with her friends, family, and especially Cameron are tested. She makes some mistakes, and she has to own up to her choices. Lily's life is never going to be the same, but it is on the path to the possibility of something better.\nThis is the first time the author and I worked together. And I have to say, I absolutely loved every minute of it. In fact, I'll go so far to say that I'm already thinking about how I can convince Lisa into getting me to read book two. *grin*\nThe author has a talent for capturing her readers. She builds a world that invites you in. There are no fights or arguments with the reader from the get-go. You feel as if you're right there, in the room with Lily, watching every moment unfold. You feel for her. You want her to do better. And that's the hallmark of a good book.\nI couldn't put the book down while I was reading it. I was drawn to Lily and completely immersed in her story. You'll fall in love with Aiden just like Lily does. And you'll want to give Lily a good shake every now and then when she makes a bad choice.\nLisa has created a character who's just trying to find her place in the world. She's a girl who's growing up, but she's making mistakes. She's learning and trying to grow from them. The author captures that well with Lily. I can definitely see the growth that she experiences over the course of the book.\nI honestly can't say enough good things about this book. If you're looking for an escape into a different world, a book that's going to make you cry, get mad, and then smile and sigh at the end, then this is a book you should pick up.

The people of Guji, Gedeo and West Guji have been demanding this new state since the 1990s. This is due to various factors such as their distinct identity, culture, language, social and economic conditions. The people in the three zones speak Gedeo and West Gedeo (Gollo) languages, while the rest of the Ethiopia speaks Amharic and Oromo.\nDuring Emperor Selassie\u2019s regime, the Guji and Gedeo people were forced to learn Amharic and Oromo and were denied the possibility of taking positions in the military or government. As a result, there was a deep resentment among the people of these regions. This led to civil unrest, protests, and eventually, the 1991-1992 Eritrean-Ethiopian War. The conflict displaced thousands of people and caused immense damage to the region.\nAfter the fall of the Derg regime, the people of Guji and Gedeo were given the chance to regain their identity and rebuild their region. However, the people still felt that they were not being given enough political autonomy and representation. They have been demanding for a separate state for years.\nThe formation of the new state would provide the people with a greater sense of security, autonomy, and self-determination. It would also allow for the implementation of unique development programs and policies that cater to the unique needs and conditions of the region. Additionally, the new state would have greater economic freedom and potential for growth, as it would not be constrained by the limitations of the current federal system.\nThe creation of a new state for the Guji and Gedeo people would also bring numerous positive societal changes. The people would be able to preserve their unique language, culture, and customs. They would also be able to establish strong bonds and relationships with their neighbors, such as the Konso people and the Sidama people. This would help to create a more interconnected and harmonious region.\nFurthermore, the new state would be able to attract foreign investment and support, which would help to boost its economy and create job opportunities for the local population. This would lead to a more vibrant and prosperous region, which would benefit not only the people of Guji, Gedeo, and West Guji, but also the rest of Ethiopia.\nIn conclusion, the people of Guji, Gedeo, and West Guji have a strong desire for a new state that would allow them to regain their sense of identity and control over their future. The creation of the Federal State of Guji/Gedeo would bring numerous positive changes to the region and would provide the people with the opportunity to fully realize their potential.\nThe result of the referendum will be declared after the completion of vote counting and determination of the validity of votes cast. It is expected that Ethiopian authorities will declare the result of the referendum within the next two weeks after the counting, certification and audit procedures are completed.\nFour years later, the National Movement for Amhara (NaMA), a political organization in Ethiopia, has raised the question of the referendum and whether a new state should be formed there.

H\u00e4gglund, who was previously party leader from 1993 to 1995, was elected to the Riksdag in 2006, but was ousted in 2007 due to the Centre Party's loss in the 2006 election.\n\nThe party's political board was also elected at the meeting.

The main issue on the agenda was who should be the new party leader following the death of the party's long-standing leader Anna Kinberg Batra in September 2018. The two declared candidates were Maria Wetterstrand and Johan Danielsson. After the first round of voting, Maria Wetterstrand was elected as the new party leader with 57.7% of the votes. Johan Danielsson received 42.3% of the votes.\n\nThe leadership election followed a process where potential candidates could express their interest in standing for the party leadership, and then be approved by the party's central executive committee.\n\nThe Swedish Centre Party was formed in 2006 as the result of a split in the Liberal Peoples Party (Folkpartiet liberalerna). The party leadership has been elected by party members since the party was formed.\n\n## Background\n\nWhen Anna Kinberg Batra became the leader of the newly formed Centre Party in 2006, she became known as \"Mrs Centre\" (S). The party is known for promoting the idea of a \"Centre Vision\", which includes a range of policy ideas relating to the environment, foreign policy, economic policy and domestic policy. The party is often seen as being to the left of the other two established \"centre\" parties in Sweden, the Moderate Party and the Liberal Party, both of which are formally labelled conservative parties. Since its formation, the Centre Party has been closely associated with Anna Kinberg Batra, and has been described as \"her party\".\n\nSince the party's formation in 2006 until Anna Kinberg Batra's death in 2018 the party's leadership was as follows:\n\n* Anna Kinberg Batra (2006\u20132018)\n\n## Election timetable\n\nThe timing of the leadership election was governed by the party's internal rules. They stipulate that the party's leadership should be elected at an extraordinary party meeting, at which the party's statutes and leadership principles should also be amended where necessary.\n\nThe party's statutes and leadership principles needed to be amended to reflect the fact that the party's leadership had been vacant since Anna Kinberg Batra's death.\n\nThe meeting was scheduled for 21 April 2019.\n\n## Nominations\n\nThe process for becoming a party leader involves expressing an interest in standing, getting approved by the party's central executive committee, and then being elected by party members.\n\nTwo candidates were approved by the party's central executive committee on 21 April 2019. They were:\n\n* Maria Wetterstrand, former leader of the Stockholm City Council (Moderate)\n* Johan Danielsson, former Minister for Energy in the \u00c5kesson government (Moderate)\n\nMaria Wetterstrand was the main candidate, and was already well-known internationally as the leader of the Stockholm City Council.\n\n## Campaigning\n\nDuring the campaign, both candidates made various policy announcements, including plans to increase the percentage of electric vehicles on Swedish roads.\n\nA key issue during the campaign was the impact of the party's leadership on party membership. In the weeks before the election, the number of party members dramatically increased. The party claimed that this was the result of the enthusiasm generated by the party leadership contest, but some media outlets reported that the dramatic increases in membership in recent months had been a consequence of internal party rules which meant that any party member who had not renewed their membership for the previous year in advance of the leadership election could now do so free of charge from 21 April onwards.\n\n## Result\n\nThe two candidates met for a head-to-head debate before the party meeting on 21 April.\n\nAt the party meeting, after the first round of voting, Maria Wetterstrand was elected as the new party leader with 57.7% of the votes. Johan Danielsson received 42.3% of the votes. The new party leader therefore received the support of the majority of the party membership.\n\nMaria Wetterstrand's win increased the size of the women's caucus in the Swedish parliament to three members, a total of one more than the number of male members of the women's caucus (who had previously included both Anna Kinberg Batra and Lena Andreasson).

After the 2006 election, five of the party's six MPs resigned from the party, prompting the party leadership to consider reforms. However, Holma won the leadership election in 2008 by a narrow margin. One of the reasons for the poor result was a strong showing of the Christian Democrats, who were seen as stealing votes from the Centre Party. The party leadership called for the two larger parties to co-operate and agreed to support the Christian Democrats in a national-government coalition with the Social Democrats.\n\nIn May 2009, Holma faced a no-confidence vote within the parliamentary group. Holma survived the vote, but only by a narrow margin, receiving 6 votes against 5.\n\nOn 23 April 2010, Holma announced that he would resign as party leader due to the continuing dissatisfaction in the party, and because he did not want to stand as a candidate for re-election.

Wallstr\u00f6m responded by pointing out that she was one of the few politicians who had opposed the war from the start, and that she was well known as someone who supported the government in its war against terrorism. According to Gallup polls, she was the most popular of all the party leaders after the election.\n\nIn May 2010, Wallstr\u00f6m confirmed that she would contest the 2010 election as a candidate for the party. However, she had not ruled out the possibility of joining a future government coalition without the Social Democrats.

In August 2010 it was reported that Wallstr\u00f6m was considering standing down after three months in the job.

The country is facing a severe economic crisis made worse by the pandemic-related lockdowns and subsequent restrictions on movement, which has further impacted an already vulnerable population.\nThe outbreak underscores the importance of maintaining routine immunization coverage: The number of measles cases might be higher than the reported ones due to the limited reporting capacity, highlighting the need to maintain routine immunization coverage to prevent the spread of the disease.\n\"We must work urgently to ensure that routine immunization services can resume, to avoid the situation getting out of hand as happened during the polio outbreak,\" said Dr Ahmed.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) continues to support the Sudanese Ministry of Health in responding to the outbreak, including in the areas of risk analysis, laboratory testing and quality control, epidemiological surveillance, case management, prevention of severe disease and death, and community engagement.\nThe organization has also provided $1.5 million in emergency funding to support the response efforts, including increasing testing capacity at the national laboratory and supporting the immunization programme to maintain routine services.\nWHO is also working with partners, including UNICEF, the World Bank, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, and several NGOs, to scale up the response to the outbreak.\nSince the beginning of the year, Sudan has experienced an increase in measles cases, with more than 60,000 cases reported across the country. The outbreak was declared in December 2021, and as of 16 November 2022, the total number of measles cases reported is 105,355.\nMeasles outbreaks can have devastating consequences, especially in poor and vulnerable communities, where outbreaks can overwhelm already stretched health systems and lead to preventable deaths. The World Health Organization estimates that around 100,000 people die each year from measles worldwide, with most of these deaths occurring in Africa and Asia.\nThe WHO has called for sustained commitment and investment to increase routine immunization coverage and strengthen health systems to better respond to outbreaks. Countries must also ensure that they have enough vaccines to respond to outbreaks and meet the needs of the population for routine immunization.\nMeasles is a highly infectious disease that spreads easily through the air. It is preventable through vaccination, with two doses of the measles vaccine providing long-term immunity. However, the spread of the disease can be slowed down by maintaining high vaccination coverage and implementing other control measures, such as isolating infected individuals and engaging with the community to raise awareness about the importance of vaccination.\nIn response to the measles outbreak in Sudan, the WHO has called for a comprehensive approach to control the outbreak, including increasing testing capacity, strengthening laboratory quality control, and scaling up routine immunization services to prevent future outbreaks.\nThe ongoing conflict and political instability in Sudan have made it difficult to respond to the outbreak, but it is essential to maintain the response efforts to prevent the spread of the disease and minimize the impact on the population.\nIn Sudan, a measles outbreak continues to take hold, with the country witnessing a spike in measles cases in the past few months. According to official data, the number of measles cases in Sudan has almost doubled in the last two weeks, reaching 175,840 as of November 7th. The Ministry of Health has declared the outbreak a national emergency", "output_2": "<s> A crisis at the National Public Health Laboratory in Khartoum, Sudan, started after it was seized by rebel forces in a military coup d&apos;\u00e9tat on December 19, 1989. The coup leader, General Omar al-Bashir, closed the laboratory and put all its staff out of work. The facility was then looted by the general&apos;s supporters, including the then-health minister, Tayseer Arja, and was never reopened.\n\"The laboratory was a key player in the fight against disease in Sudan, especially outbreaks of cholera and meningitis,\" said Dr. Martin Antonio, a former chief of the laboratory. \"The destruction of the lab had a devastating impact across the country. It was a major blow to the public health system in Sudan.\"\nThe aftermath of this tragedy was that patients who needed diagnosis and treatment for infectious diseases, such as typhoid, cholera, and meningitis, in the greater Khartoum area and across Sudan had no access to proper laboratory testing and care. The affected populations included IDPs, internally displaced persons, people in rural areas, and conflict-displaced populations, who were particularly vulnerable to outbreaks of infectious diseases.\nIn the years that followed, Dr. Antonio and other international public health workers, led by the United Nations Children&apos;s Fund (UNICEF), the World Health Organization (WHO), and M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), made several attempts to revive the National Public Health Laboratory. However, they faced significant challenges, including a lack of funding, political instability, and the general disarray of the health system in Sudan.\nThe laboratory has been closed for 30 years now, and Dr. Antonio, who was the longest-serving expatriate head of mission in Sudan until 2019, remains committed to restoring the laboratory and reviving the public health system in Sudan. \"The closure of the lab has caused countless deaths from preventable diseases, particularly among children and the most vulnerable populations,\" he said. \"It is our collective responsibility to ensure that the laboratory is reopened and that people in Sudan have access to quality public health services.\"\nDespite the enormous challenges and the setbacks, Dr. Antonio remains hopeful that the laboratory will one day be reopened and that the public health system in Sudan will be revived. \"It is not too late to fix the damage caused by the closure of the laboratory.

An official at the laboratory said staff was traumatized and in hiding after an April crackdown on demonstrations left at least 118 dead.\nAn expert in infectious diseases in Asia said the closure could exacerbate an existing Ebola outbreak in neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo and create an opening for a deadly disease, such as monkeypox, to spread more widely.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a perfect place for an outbreak to begin if there is one coming and for an outbreak to spread,\u201d said Dr. Michael R. Gordon, a health specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank that focuses on global health.\nIn a phone interview with Dr. Gordon in early June, Dr. Abdelmoumen S. Juma, the national public health laboratory director, said the Khartoum laboratory is the only one of its kind in Sudan and is key to fighting infectious diseases like Ebola, yellow fever and the plague. Until it reopens, the country must turn to other labs for testing, but that can be costly.\nThe laboratory, which has 24 employees, was closed after demonstrations began in late December. Staff members were attacked by government supporters, and their laboratory equipment was smashed or stolen, Dr. Juma said. Even now, he added, many of them have not returned to work.\nOn Monday, Sudan\u2019s defense minister, Awad Mohamed Ahmed, announced in a televised news conference that the airport, roads and bridges in Khartoum would reopen on June 8.\nBut the laboratory closure has affected Sudan\u2019s ability to test cases of Ebola, the deadly hemorrhagic fever that has raged since 2018 in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.\nThe United States and Europe have provided more than $46 million in emergency health assistance, including to support testing in Sudan. \u201cThe loss of the laboratory will obviously affect the ability of Sudan to respond to the outbreak in the D.R.C.,\u201d said Jeremy Konyndyk, a senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development who was previously with the United Nations\u2019 World Food Program. \u201cThey will now have to rely on testing at labs in Kampala or Nairobi, or even in Europe, which will be much more expensive and time-consuming.\u201d\nIn a statement, the World Health Organization said it had already provided testing kits to Sudanese labs to respond to the outbreak, and the W.H.O. Emergencies Program said it was stepping up efforts to identify cases in Sudan. \u201cCurrently, we do not have any suspected cases of Ebola in Sudan,\u201d the statement said.\nIn May, the World Health Organization issued a notice calling for countries to increase surveillance for Ebola, noting that it had reached an outbreak area close to the Sudan and South Sudan border.\nWhen the virus spreads, it causes violent bouts of diarrhea, vomiting and fever. It can be lethal in 50 percent of cases if not treated.\nEbola has killed more than 1,800 people in the ongoing outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, according to the World Health Organization. Monkeypox, another fever-causing virus, has caused outbreaks in central and west Africa and is not new to Sudan. It spreads through contact with small mammals or contaminated objects and can cause fever and rashes. It does not spread easily from person to person.\nKenya\u2019s President, Uhuru Kenyatta, says he has tested positive for Covid-19 and will immediately begin isolating at home.\nIreland will not receive any doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine before the end of the year, the government said.\nThe first phase of a trial in the United States of an antiviral Covid-19 pill by Merck failed to show it prevented illness in healthy adults who were not vaccinated, the company said.</s>", "output_4": "<s> A crisis at the National Public Health Laboratory in Khartoum, Sudan, started after it was seized by the military last year, leading to interruptions in critical services and a reduction in the quality of laboratory tests. everyone had to resort to sending samples to other laboratories, including in the capital, to be tested, but the cost of these tests has increased by up to 300 percent.\nThe crisis at the National Public Health Laboratory in Khartoum dates back to last October, when a group of military officers staged a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat to topple Sudan\u2019s Transitional Government. After the coup, the building was occupied by the military, who demanded that the Ministry of Health evict the laboratory staff and hand over the building to the military intelligence. In response, laboratory workers refused to leave the building and stayed inside. The Ministry of Health also refused to evict the laboratory staff and the matter was resolved through negotiations between the two parties.\nAfter seizing the building, the military detained 18 laboratory workers in December and released them after a few days. After a month, the military released a statement indicating that it had agreed to reopen the laboratory on the condition that it becomes a military medical laboratory. The laboratory workers once again refused to evict the building and stayed inside, leading to an escalation of the crisis.\nDr. Mohamed Taj al-Din, President of the Sudanese Doctors\u2019 Syndicate, confirmed that the crisis has had a significant impact on the country\u2019s public health. He explained that the laboratory is the only laboratory in Sudan that is accredited by the World Health Organization for food and water testing, and that it is also the reference laboratory for all diagnostic laboratories in the country. As a result, the laboratory caters to 35 out of the 37 states in Sudan, along with the Red Sea and the Nile River basins.\nThe Sudanese Doctors\u2019 Syndicate, the Sudanese Medical Association, and the Sudanese Public Health Association have joined together to form the Khartoum Health Care Front. This group has been trying to reach a consensus with the military and the Ministry of Health to solve the crisis.\nDr. Khalid Hamouda, former Assistant Minister of Health, explained that the main problem is the financial situation, as the laboratory had to resort to sending samples to other laboratories, which increased the cost of tests by up to 300 percent. He added that in some cases, the tests were not completed due to the high cost, leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment. Due to the financial crisis, laboratory work is still suspended, and the quality of tests is uncertain.\nMore than two months after the coup, the laboratory has still not reopened, and laboratory workers continue to work in the occupied building. The Sudanese Doctors\u2019 Syndicate and the public health sector are demanding that the military withdraw from the laboratory and allow workers to return to their jobs. However, the military\u2019s presence and control of the building have continued unabated.\nThe Sudanese revolution awaits a just peace\nA day after the start of the military coup, Sudanese masses took to the street on the 21 October 2021 to demand the immediate end to the military takeover, the departure of the military from the streets, the reinstatement of Sudan\u2019s sovereign institutions and the protection of the revolutionary gains.\nFor almost a month, there has been no response from Sudanese institutions, including the judiciary, the legislative assembly and the constitutional declaration body tasked with formulating a new constitution for the country. Not a single statement has been issued by the Sudanese state or its international partners, other than the call for the immediate halt of the use of force and the restoration of the democratic institutions.\nIn an effort to avoid addressing the ongoing military takeover, the ruling Transitional Council has resorted to calling for an inclusive national conference to address Sudan\u2019s internal crises. The council\u2019s spokesperson, Faisal Mohamed Saleh, described the coup as a moment of truth for all Sudanese and called for a national pact to rebuild a new democratic Sudan. The call for a consensus-based pact stands in contrast to the TMC\u2019s own military approach to solving Sudan\u2019s political problems.\nWithout addressing the ongoing military coup, Sudanese Prime Minister Abdallah Hamdok has called for a national unity government.

The military takeover comes at a time when the revolution that began in December 2018 has stalled, with political groups and the Transitional Military Council trying to outmanoeuvre each other, leading to a military crisis and an economic collapse.\nOn the morning of Saturday, January 25, the Transitional Military Council (TMC) led an army raid on the capital of Sudan, Khartoum. It was the climax of a military coup that has divided the country into two feuding camps and plunged it into a military crisis and an economic collapse.

The agreement paved the way for Sudan to embark on a democratic transition, with the TMC and FFC dividing the government to create a Sovereign Council to oversee a three-year transition leading to elections.\nThe Sudanese Professionals Associations (SPA), whose members include doctors, engineers, teachers, and lawyers, played a pivotal role in leading the revolution, which began in December 2018 and forced long-time autocrat Omar al-Bashir to step down. Since then, the SPA has continued its anti-regime campaign, leading protests and strikes. The protests were initially peaceful, but as the Sudanese political situation deteriorated in the summer of 2019, the situation became increasingly fluid. In July 2019, the SPA, the FFC, and several other political groups signed a charter that set out a roadmap for the country\u2019s transformation. The charter stipulated that the SPA should lead the transition until an inclusive government was formed.\nSince the military coup, the public healthcare system has been in disarray. The National Public Health Laboratory (NPHW) in Khartoum is one of the main referral laboratories in the country, with over 100 staff members who specialize in various fields, including virology, microbiology, and clinical pathology. It is also the only laboratory in Sudan that conducts sophisticated diagnostic tests for Zika, Ebola, and other infectious diseases. However, the laboratory was looted and many staff members were killed or injured during the coup.
