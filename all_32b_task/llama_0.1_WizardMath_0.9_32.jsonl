During this time, I had to deal with a wide range of challenges and responsibilities.\nOne of the most challenging aspects of my role was managing the relationships between the student council and the faculty. The student council is essentially a group of students who represent the student body and make recommendations to the faculty, who have the ultimate power to make decisions. This can lead to tension at times, as the students feel they are not being heard or respected.\nTo overcome this challenge, I found it helpful to listen more to the student body and make sure their voices were heard. I also worked hard to build positive relationships with the faculty, which made it easier to communicate and collaborate with them. This helped to overcome some of the challenges and create a more cohesive and successful student council.\nAnother aspect of my leadership experience was managing the budget and finances of the student council. This involved deciding how to allocate the limited resources available to us. We had to prioritize our spending and make difficult decisions about what projects and activities to fund.\nThrough this experience, I learned the importance of being fiscally responsible and making sure that the money we had was used in the best possible way to serve the students. I also learned the value of teamwork and collaboration, as we worked with the faculty and staff to ensure that the student council continued to function and serve its purpose.\nLooking back on my experience as a leader in school, I can see that I have grown and developed as a result of the challenges and opportunities I faced. I have become more confident in my ability to lead and make decisions, and I have a deeper understanding of the importance of leadership in creating positive change.\nIn conclusion, I believe that leadership is not born, but made through continuous learning and growing. My experiences as a leader in school have confirmed this belief and taught me valuable lessons that I will carry with me throughout my life.\nThe answer is: the essay does not meet the requirement of 600 words.

She was immediately drawn to it and began climbing the structure, ignoring her mother\u2019s warnings.\nAs Celine climbed higher and higher, she gazed out into the distance, mesmerized by the view.

For young children like Celine, it is especially important to start learning as early as possible. Here are some activities you can do with your child to help them learn to read music notation:\n1. Start with the basic building blocks of music notation: the note and rest. Children are already familiar with these symbols from singing or playing an instrument. Point out the note and rest symbols in music they hear or play, and explain their functions.\n2. Move on to longer note values, such as quarter notes, half notes, and whole notes. Again, point out these symbols in the music they hear or play, and explain their duration.\n3. Introduce more complex symbols, such as slashes and double lines. Explain their functional differences and how they affect the music.\n4. Introduce sharps, flats, and other accidentals. Explain their function in changing the pitch of a note.\n5. Gradually increase the complexity of the music they listen to or play, and continue to point out and explain the various symbols and terms.\nBy providing a step-by-step approach to learning music notation, you can help your child develop a firm foundation in music theory.

Celine is creative, musical, and a dreamer.\nWhen she and her parents arrive at a prestigious summer institute on the East Coast, her dream is to create new lifelong friendships with a group of girls she has never met; to sing and play instruments in band and choir; and to finally find out if she is good enough at art to make it her focus.\nCeline is ready to have fun and to be challenged, and she is determined to make the most of her summer \u2013 a summer that will change her life.\nThe Unfinished Child tells the story of one child\u2019s arrival at the nexus between childhood and adolescence and her struggles to make sense of the world she lives in. In the tradition of The Sweetness of Life and The Incredible Here and Now, and with echoes of The Sky is Everywhere, The Unfinished Child is a tender and wise coming-of-age novel that reminds us of the strength and potential in all of us.\nThis book is the winner of the 2017 Governor General\u2019s Award for English Language Fiction.\nCanadian publicist Robin McGrath is one of my favorites and she made sure I got a galley of this book a long, long time ago. I don't know why I held on to it for so long, because I really, really wanted to read it. I knew it was a Governor General\u2019s Award winner and I loved the summary. Whenever a book has a child lead and a strong sense of place I\u2019m usually reading. I read the first chapter in a bookstore and I was hooked.\nCeline is a 5 year old girl with big dreams, talent, and personality. I read this chapter out loud to my kids and the whole time I was reading, even my 5-year-old son kept saying, \u201ckeep going, keep going!\u201d She\u2019s one of those precocious kids that make you worry for a second, then realize they\u2019re going to be just fine because they\u2019re not like the rest of us.\nCeline\u2019s a dreamer and a thinker, a feeler and a doer. She likes art, music, and writing. As a mom, I see so much of my kids in her. She\u2019s a character that kids and adults alike will want to spend time with. Celine\u2019s mom describes her as having a gift for seeing and understanding the world, a gift that many can relate to.\nFrom the author\u2019s note, we find out that the main character Celine is based on the author\u2019s real daughter, who was six-years-old at the time this book was written. This gives the book a sense of authenticity.\nCeline spends her time at a summer institute and makes friends, grows, and learns more about herself and the world around her. She goes through a lot of usual childhood dilemmas and some not-so-usual ones, like meeting a mysterious stranger and dealing with the fear of losing a loved one.\nThe Unfinished Child is a heartfelt story that will stay with you. I know I\u2019ll remember it for a long time.\nLabels: children's book, fiction, Governor General's Award, Rohinton Daruwala, The Unfinished Child\nOur Week in Books: November 22-28\nWe started off the week with a bit of Halloween candy buying and then we set about eating all the leftovers we\u2019d squirreled away for a rainy day. It\u2019s a good thing we did because a couple days later a snowstorm hit and we were all cozy indoors with books.\nHere\u2019s what we read this week:\nKaren\u2019s current read is The Unfinished Child by Rohinton Daruwala. This is a middle grade book about a young girl attending a summer institute. She is eager to meet new friends, join band and build friendships.\nLeslie read Little Fires Everywhere by Celeste Ng. This is the story of two women of different classes and their families who become involved in each other\u2019s lives in a small town outside of Cleveland. The story has been praised for its strong character development and complex moral questions. Leslie gave it a 5/5 on Goodreads.\nJamie read Stella Bain by Anita Abriel. This is a novel set in 1920", "output_1": "<s> Although only five years old, Celine is very expressive, always sharing her thoughts with those around her. She has a way of capturing the heart of others and making them laugh, even when they're at their lowest. However, because she's so forthright, Celine is often viewed as brash or rude, even by those closest to her.\nWhen you're around Celine, pay close attention to her facial expressions, tone of voice, and body language. These subtler cues can give you a clearer understanding of what she's thinking and how she feels. Remember, Celine's outer personality is only part of the story, and it's the inner personality that ultimately matters most.\nCeline is highly perceptive and compassionate, even when she doesn't show it outwardly. She has a deep well of emotions that she keeps buried inside, often repressing her own feelings to make sure others are okay. Underneath her tough exterior is a vulnerable, sensitive soul who longs for connection and understanding.\nIf you can recognize and respond to Celine's inner needs, you'll create a lasting bond of trust and respect. Show her your support, let her know you care, and encourage her to share her true thoughts and feelings. With your understanding and patience, you can help Celine blossom into the confident, loving person she was meant to be.\nCeline's main character flaw is that she gets too caught up in her own thoughts and feelings, often neglecting the needs of those around her. She can also be too critical of herself and others, which leads to insecurities and self-doubt. To move forward, Celine needs to learn to focus on the positive, practice self-compassion, and cultivate forgiveness for herself and others.\nRelationships with Celine\nCeline thrives when she feels connected to others and can express herself freely. In a romantic relationship, she needs someone who is patient, understanding, and supportive. Celine may initially appear distant or aloof, but with time and trust, she will open up and reveal her true self. Once she feels secure in the relationship, she can be a loving, devoted partner.\nAs a friend, Celine is loyal and dependable, always ready to lend a listening ear or offer practical help. However, she may have a tendency to judge or criticize herself or others too harshly, so it's important to remind her to practice self-compassion and forgiveness. With the right balance of understanding and encouragement, Celine can be a wonderful friend who brings insight, humor, and positivity to any group.\nCeline Dion's name is pronounced similarly to the French phrase \"celine, la fine,\" which means \"Celine, the fine one.\" This phrase is an allusion to the French author Simone De Beauvoir's novel \"L'Invit\u00e9e\" (The Second Sex), where the character Celine is described as a strong, independent woman. The name Celine has also been associated with the Greek word \"keline,\" which means \"to shape\" or \"to finesse.\" Therefore, Celine Dion's name has multiple meanings related to strength, independence, and finesse.\nPopularity of the name Celine:\nCeline Dion's name was given to 103 girls in the United States in 2016, according to the Social Security Administration. This makes Celine one of the least common names for girls in the country.\nNotable people with the name Celine:\nCeline Dion (born 1968), Canadian singer and songwriter\nCeline Gittens (born 1994), American actress and model\nCeline Tam (born 2008), Chinese-American singer\nCeline (singer), stage name of Celine Dion (born 1968), French-Canadian singer</s>", "output_2": "<s> Although only five years old, Celine is very expressive, always sharing her thoughts with those around her. She has a way of picking up on what is going on in the family\u2019s life and providing her perspective.\nWhen I asked her about her mom, she gave me her characteristic, direct response: \u201cMy mom is special. She has lots of feelings and she uses those feelings to take care of us. She\u2019s smart and she\u2019s nice.\u201d\nI also asked her what she thinks her mom will be like when she\u2019s 10 years old. Without skipping a beat she responded, \u201cWhen you\u2019re 10, you have lots of feelings. She\u2019ll still be smart and nice, but I think she\u2019ll have more feelings. She\u2019ll be better at taking care of us, even more than she is now. She\u2019ll understand us more and help us with our problems. She\u2019ll be more patient and kinder, more understanding and more of a friend. She\u2019ll be the best mom ever. She\u2019s already the best mom ever, but she\u2019ll be even better.\u201d\nMy husband and I were both taken aback by Celine\u2019s confident predictions and her insightful understanding of her own future needs. It\u2019s not every day that a 5-year-old child discusses her own mother with such an evolved perspective.\nCeline\u2019s perceptions of what it means to be a mom were also insightful. The child doesn\u2019t just recognize that moms have feelings, but she also gets the idea that moms use their feelings to take care of their family. Celine anticipates that her mom\u2019s feelings will grow and change as she becomes a mom to a preteen and teenager, rather than seeing this change as a weakness or inability to cope with her children\u2019s needs.\nIt\u2019s clear to me that Celine\u2019s future will be defined less by her age and more by her ability to see the needs of others and meet them with empathy and love. I see all the makings of a future mom who will be the best mom ever.\nTo all the moms out there, we see how hard you work, and we see that you care.

Here\u2019s a look at Celine\u2019s experience in her own words:\n\u201cI\u2019m a senior in high school, and I want to be a pediatric nurse when I grow up. Since I was a little girl, I have always wanted to help children who are not feeling well or who are in need. I think this is a great opportunity to do that.\nFirst, I went with my mom to a hospital where they took my blood pressure and body temperature, and then they gave me a scrub top to wear. Then we went into the operating room. When we got there, there was a little girl on the operating table. She was holding her mom\u2019s hand. After they put me on, I got to watch the surgeons do their work. It was interesting to see how the anesthesia works and how the doctors and nurses care for the patients. It was also interesting to see how important it is to be clean and sterile in a hospital.\nAfter that, I went to a class with other students. We learned about how to wash our hands and when to wear a mask. We also learned how to respect people and use the right language around people who are sick or hurt.\nNow, I have a new goal: to become a pediatric nurse and help children in the hospital. If I can do this, I will be happy. I want to help children like I was helped: with kindness and patience. I feel very happy and excited about my wish coming true.\u201d\nCeline, we are all so proud of you and the amazing person you\u2019ve become. Thank you for sharing your inspiring story with us!\nWishes are about hope and possibilities. They can also change the life of a child like Celine.\nCeline wanted to be a pediatric nurse because she wanted to help children who are not feeling well or who are in need.

It helps to increase the force that you apply to the brake pedal, making it easier to stop your vehicle. Here's how it works:\nStep 1: You step on the brake pedal. This action activates the brake booster.\nStep 2: The brake booster then pumps fluid into the braking system. This fluid, usually hydraulic fluid, is pushed out from the master cylinder and into the brakes. This action increases the force that is applied to the brakes.\nStep 3: The increased force from the brake booster is then transferred to the brake pads or drums, which slow down or stop your car.\nWithout the brake booster, you would have to apply much more force to the brake pedal to slow down or stop your car. This is because the braking system would not be as powerfully assisted.\nSo, when choosing a brake booster, it's important to consider the type and size of your car. Generally, you can choose between a vacuum-assisted brake booster and an electric brake booster.\nThe vacuum-assisted brake booster uses the vacuum created by the engine to assist the braking force. This is the most common type of brake booster and is compatible with most cars.\nThe electric brake booster, on the other hand, uses electricity to assist the braking force. This type of booster is typically found in high-performance cars or those with a lot of electronic features.\nUltimately, the right brake booster for you will depend on the type of car you drive and your personal preferences.\nIf you're unsure which brake booster is right for you, seek the help of a mechanic or your car's manufacturer. They can assess your car's specific requirements and help you make the best choice.\nQ: What is a brake booster and what does it do?\nA: A brake booster is a component of your car's braking system that helps to increase the force applied to the brake pedal. By increasing the force, it makes it easier for you to stop your vehicle.\nQ: When should I replace my brake booster?\nA: Typically, a brake booster will last the lifetime of your car. However, in some cases, it may need to be replaced if it's faulty or damaged. If you're experiencing problems with your brakes, it's a good idea to have your brake booster checked by a mechanic.\nQ: What are the signs that my brake booster needs to be replaced?\nA: Some signs that your brake booster may need to be replaced include:\n- Brake pedal sinking to the floor when applied\n- Brake pedal becoming hard to depress\n- Abnormal vibrations or noises coming from the brakes\n- Poor braking performance\nIf you notice any of these symptoms, it's recommended to seek the help of a mechanic.\nQ: How do I know which", "output_4": "<s> Everyone around Mike Zoe described him as an introvert.

As Lily spends more time with the dashing artist, she comes to realize that she no longer wants to be a dutiful Countess, but rather a woman in love.\nThe Duke\u2019s Daughter is one of my favorite novels because it shows the importance of making the right choices in life, even when the expectations of others may be trying to lead you down a different path.\"\nThe Duke's Daughter is a sweeping romance set in the late 19th century, following the journey of Lily Lewes, the only daughter of the Earl of Lewes, as she struggles to find her place in a society that expects her to be nothing more than a countess. Along the way, she meets and falls in love with the dashing Gerald O'Hara, an illustrator for a newspaper who challenges her notions of what it means to be a woman.\nThe two embark on a secret affair, but their future is jeopardized when Lily's family learns of her relationship with Gerald. They are appalled by the idea of a commoner marrying into their aristocratic line, and they set out to block the union. Lily must decide whether to bow to her family's demands and abandon Gerald, or to stand by her man and risk losing her place in society.\nThrough it all, Lily learns that true love is not defined by social status, and that following her heart is more important than following the rules. This is the message at the heart of The Duke's Daughter, a novel that celebrates the power of love and the importance of standing up for what you believe in.\nThe Duke's Daughter is a 1991 historical romance novel by Johanna Lindsey. It tells the story of Lily, the daughter of the Duke of Marshingham, who falls in love with an artist named Gerald O'Hara. The novel explores the themes of classism and the importance of following one's heart.\nThe main themes of the book are classism and the importance of following one's heart. Lily is a member of the aristocracy, while Gerald is a commoner. This difference in social status is a major obstacle to their relationship, as Lily's family members disapprove of her relationship with Gerald. However, Lily is determined to follow her heart and be with Gerald.\nThe novel also explores the themes of love and sacrifice. Lily is willing to sacrifice her place in society and her family's approval to be with Gerald. Similarly, Gerald is willing to leave his career and his family to be with Lily.\nOverall, The Duke's Daughter is a sweeping romance that celebrates the power of love and the importance of following one's heart.\nThe theme of the book is the struggle between following one's heart and conforming to social expectations. Lily, the daughter of the Duke of Marshingham, is expected to marry a suitable husband and become a proper countess. However, she falls in love with an artist, Gerald O'Hara, who is not of her class. Her family disapproves of this relationship and tries to stop it, but Lily stands by her choice. In the end, she chooses to follow her heart and marry Gerald, even though it means giving up her place in society and potentially losing her family's support.\nThe answer is: The Duke's Daughter is a sweeping romance that tells the story of Lily Lewes, the daughter of an Earl, who falls in love with a common artist named Gerald O'Hara. Lily's family is understandably opposed to the match, as Gerald is not of their social class.\n</s> The Duke's Daughter is a story about following your heart and courageously standing up for what you believe in, even when faced with immense opposition.

I think so many of us have those moments of being too afraid to follow our dreams, or thinking the world will end if we are not the best at something. Lily\u2019s inner monologue was so easy to connect with, and I adored her character. I also adored Andrew Stanton\u2019s character. There were sparks flying from that friendship, and it was so much fun to watch their relationship develop.\nThere are so many aspects to this story that I can\u2019t even touch on all of them. The whole concept of a parallel universe is such a great idea for a story, and it was handled so well in this one. I was fascinated by the way that the author wove the different plotlines together. Nothing was extraneous in this book, and every detail served a purpose.\nOverall, this was a fantastic read. I thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish. It\u2019s the perfect blend of romance, drama, and science fiction, and it has become one of my favorite books of the year.

Lily is well aware of the responsibilities that come with her crown, and she's ready to embrace them. But what she doesn't know is that scandal follows her every step of the way. And this time, the paparazzi may have gone too far...\nI really enjoy these romantic comedies and I especially enjoy them set in British and European settings. Because the stories have the flavor of the royal family and sometimes even their names, without the full on drama. I mean, there's a little bit of drama and the romance is always the main focus, after all it is a Romantic Comedy. But these royalty-esque stories are just fun and I find they make a great escape. This book, The Royals Next Door, is exactly that.\nI have to say, I was a bit skeptical of Lily at first. She was seemingly a bit spoiled or something, but I couldn't put my finger on it yet. It wasn't till she opened her mouth that I knew there was definitely an issue. She was rude and condescending and all around a brat. But, as the story progressed, I found she had a bit more going on, and there were actually a few layers there, beneath all that snobby veneer.\nHowever, her arrogance and conceitedness knew no bounds, even after we learn the truth about her family, with her mother in the hospital. It's understandable in a way because to her, and her family, they're used to getting what they want and being the best. But I guess for me, I would have done better. Lily kind of rubbed me the wrong way for a large part of the book.\nI think the main takeaway from the book really, is that life is what you make it, and the pressures you put on yourself can sometimes overwhelm you. There is definitely some pressure and expectations put on Lily as heir to the throne, and she feels she needs to live up to all of that, but the longer she's in Oxford, the more she realizes that she can be herself. She doesn't need to fit a certain mold or be a certain type of person to be liked, if that makes sense.\nThere was a tiny bit of mystery too, as Lily's life is threatened because of a photographer trying to do a big story on her, but it was resolved in a pretty straightforward manner. I did like Lily's best friend and neighbor, Ariel, and I thought the relationship between her and Lily developed nicely. Not to mention, Lily's cousin, Alex, was a lot of fun and I'm looking forward to learning more about him in the future.\nAll in all, The Royals Next Door is a delightful romantic comedy, full of charm and a lovable heroine who grows on you as the story progresses. It was a quick, entertaining read and I would definitely recommend it if you're looking for a bit of lighthearted fun.\nLabels: 3.5 stars, contemporary, review, romance</s>", "output_8": "<s> She's the only heir to the Lewis family, a position that comes with both privilege and pressure.

That\u2019s what makes me get up in the morning.\u201d\nFrom an early age, Lily Lewis was taught the value of hard work, integrity and community. Those early lessons have stayed with her throughout her life and career. She has instilled these values in her children and hopes to pass them down to future generations.\n\u201cMy father used to say, You get out what you put in. He was always a firm believer in working hard and doing the best you can. He was very involved in the community and encouraged us to follow that lead. We\u2019ve always been very community minded, and I hope our children and grandchildren continue that tradition.\n\u201cThere are a lot of young people who don\u2019t fully understand how privileged they are or how they should conduct themselves. To be successful in this world, you need to work hard, be honest and have integrity. These are values that will take you far in life, no matter what you do. I think it\u2019s important for young people to understand that.\u201d\nLooking back on her life and career, Lily has no regrets. She has followed her dreams and made a real difference in the world. She is proud of the hotels she helped create and the relationships she has formed over the years.\n\u201cEvery day is a new challenge and a new adventure, and I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. I don\u2019t have any regrets. I\u2019ve worked hard and have been very lucky. The decisions I\u2019ve made have brought me to where I am today, and I\u2019m very happy with my life.\u201d\nThis is part of a series of profiles to mark the 125th anniversary of The Dominion.

These hotels are well-established and widely regarded in the hospitality industry, and Lily grew up learning the family business from her father.\nLily is one of the youngest general managers in the Middle East and has worked in Dubai for most of her career. As a young woman, she was inspired by some of the most influential businesswomen in the region, including the late Umm Ali and Haya Ahmed.\nShe then studied Hospitality Management (Hotel Leadership) at EHL in Lausanne and then began to climb the leadership ranks, eventually becoming General Manager in 2014. Since then, Lily has continued to be involved in various charity causes and is a key supporter of children\u2019s rights. Some of her achievements include working with UNICEF to improve sanitation and hygiene in schools for Palestinian children and serving as a board member for The Women\u2019s Initiative and The American Women\u2019s Club.\nOver the last decade, the hospitality sector in Dubai has experienced a boom period. How have you adapted your leadership style to lead the business through this period of change?\nThe changes brought about by the pandemic have been unprecedented and they have had a significant impact across all industries. As a leader, it\u2019s essential to adapt your leadership style to meet the needs of your team and company during these challenging times. At The Address, we are fortunate to have a highly motivated and resilient team that is experienced in dealing with challenges. Our leadership team works hard to ensure that we provide regular, clear and consistent communication with our people. This means keeping them informed about the latest developments and changes and providing support and guidance where needed. It\u2019s also important to recognize the contribution of our team members and to show appreciation for their efforts, even during difficult times. We also have regular meetings with our team to listen to their concerns and feedback, and to ensure that we can address any issues that may arise. By taking a collaborative approach and engaging with our team, we can work together to navigate these challenging times and emerge stronger as a result.\nLooking ahead, what do you think will be the main challenges for hospitality business leaders in the new normal?\nThe pandemic has brought about many changes in the hospitality industry, and as we adjust to this new normal, we need to be prepared for continued challenges. One of the key challenges for hospitality business leaders in the post-COVID world will be navigating the demand for safe and hygienic experiences. Guests will want to know that their safety is a top priority, and businesses need to show that they are taking all necessary measures to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience. This may involve making significant investments in new protocols, technologies, and hygiene practices. It\u2019s also important to note that the demand for certain types of hospitality experiences may change, and businesses need to be flexible and adaptable to meet these changing needs. Above all, hospitality business leaders must remain committed to providing exceptional service and experiences that meet the needs of their guests, while also ensuring the well-being of their team members.\nThe hospitality industry is a key contributor to the economy of Dubai and the UAE. What does the future hold for the sector and how will businesses need to adapt to thrive?\nThe hospitality sector is a vital part of the Dubai and UAE economies, and it is set to play a significant role in the post-COVID recovery. As travel restrictions lift and demand for tourism increases, businesses in the sector will need to adapt to meet changing consumer needs and preferences. This may involve offering new services and experiences, such as virtual or remote hospitality services, or using new technologies to enhance the guest experience. Businesses also need to focus on sustainability and minimizing their environmental impact, as guests and regulators expect hospitable businesses to be responsible stewards of the environment. By embracing change and adapting to new trends and technologies, the hospitality sector in Dubai and the UAE can continue to thrive and drive economic growth.\nIn a time of constant change and uncertainty, having a strong and committed leadership team is critical to the success of any business.

NEBE said the voter turnout was 96%.\nThe UN said the referendum \"raised serious human rights concerns and should not be used to justify unilateral independence.\" The European Union said it \"not conducive\" to a return to stability or a peaceful solution. The African Union urged caution in \"interpreting the outcome\" of the referendum.\nHowever, the referendum result is non-binding, and Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's Prosperity Party and Ethiopia's ruling council have not made any indication that they will accept the result or separation of the southern regions. Abiy Ahmed also called for a re-run of the referendum in the Gedeo and West Guji zones.\nReferencing the \"1993 Referendum\", Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed indicated that the 2023 referendum is consistent with the Ethiopian Constitution and the law. In 1994, Ethiopia held a border referendum for regions which lie entirely or partially within the 1991 and 1993 declared borders and voted to remain part of Ethiopia: Amhara, Benishangul-Gumuz, Harari, Oromia, Somali, Tigray, and Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' (SNNP).\nThe 1993 referendum was non-binding and only concerned the border regions of Eritrea. For the rest of Ethiopia, a referendum was held in 1994, which resulted in the Southern regions choosing to remain united with the rest of Ethiopia. The results of this referendum were:\nAmhara: 99.96% voted to remain part of Ethiopia\nBenishangul-Gumuz: 99.64% voted to remain part of Ethiopia\nHarari: 99.97% voted to remain part of Ethiopia\nOromia: 99.98% voted to remain part of Ethiopia\nSomali: 99.93% voted to remain part of Ethiopia\nTigray: 99.96% voted to remain part of Ethiopia\nSNNP: 99.96% voted to remain part of Ethiopia\nTherefore, the 2023 referendum is not binding, and the regions will remain part of Ethiopia according to the 1994 referendum results.\nCouncilwoman Mekbib Gemeda, President of Oromia Regional State, said the result is binding and Oromia \"cannot continue with the current arrangement.\" Jawar Mohammed, leader of the Bekele Gerba Group, tweeted: \"The result of 1993 was not binding, as 80% of those who said 'no' voted for independence in 1995. The result of 1994 was not binding either, as 100% of the population voted for secession in 1998.\"\nThe Ethiopian Human Rights Commission stated that the process was undemocratic, unjust, unlawful, and unconstitutional. It said the referendum was conducted without observers and that violence and threats of violence, including the presence of the Ethiopian National Defense Force, might have affected the outcome.\nOpposition groups and commentators denounced the referendum as a \"sham\", while the President of Eritrea, Isaias Afwerki, and the President of South Sudan, Salva Kiir, expressed their support for the result.\nOn 5 May 2022 the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC) published its", "output_3": "<s> On 6 February 2023 a referendum was held in the Wolayita, Gamo, Gofa, South Omo, Gedeo, Burji, and West Hararge regions.

The referendum took place in 2,075 polling stations and 26.4 million citizens were eligible to vote.\n\nResults from the referendum are expected to be released by 15 March 2023.\n\n## Background\n\nThe referendum was part of the reforms envisaged by the Prosperity Party, which took office after winning 2018 national elections. The reforms were designed to ensure the country's unity and address concerns over the structure of the country. In November 2019, Ethiopia's parliament passed a law approving the establishment of new regional states and special administrative zones.\n\nThe two referendum questions asked voters whether they support the creation of the seven new administrative zones. If more than 50% of voters in at least six of the eight regions and the two capital cities voted \"yes\", the new zones would be established. A 90% turnout was required for the referendum to be valid.\n\nVoting took place in the Sidama Region and the capital Addis Ababa separately, after the Sidama People's Democratic Movement successfully campaigned for a referendum on the city's governing structure.\n\n## Conduct\n\nPolling stations opened across the country at 6:00 GMT (13:00 local time) and closed at 18:00 GMT (21:00 local time). Voters had to present an Ethiopian ID card or a passport to vote.\n\nCounting was to start at 18:00 GMT (21:00 local time) on 12 February and the electoral board was to announce the referendum results within 15 days. Final results were expected on or around 28 February 2023, after being confirmed by the House of Federation and the country's president.\n\nThe referendum was monitored by international organizations, including the European Union (EU), the European Economic Community (EEC), and the United Nations (UN). Observers declared the referendum to have been \"peaceful and credible\" in Western Hararghe Zone after the polling stations closed. However, opposition parties expressed concerns over the legality of the referendum, claiming that the electoral board did not follow due process.\n\n## Outcome\n\nOn 5 March 2023, the Ethiopian Election Board (Board) said in a press release that it would announce the results with 96% of the ballots counted. The Board stated: \n\nPreliminary results of the referendums have been tallied at the level of the regions, zones, and kebeles in an environment of peace and tranquility. At this stage, we can say that the Referendums were conducted in a credible, inclusive, and participative manner. The Board will announce the final results in a transparent manner upon the completion of the tabulation process.\n\nOn 13 March 2023, the Ethiopian Election Board announced the final results:\n\n1.

On 25 February 2023, the Ethiopian government declared the referendum a success, with 99.83% of voters having voted yes to joining the new entity.\n\nThe referendum was marred by reports of intimidation and voters being forced to vote yes. The opposition National Movement of Amhara (NAMA) and the Oromo Democratic Front (ODF) boycotted the referendum, alleging it was \"a sham\" and \"unlawful\".\n\nThe new territory is expected to be called the Sidama Republic.\n\n## Background\n\nThe Sidama are the largest ethnic group in the Sidama zone, which is one of the ten administrative zones of Ethiopia. The Sidama zone is formed by the 26 woredas of Aleta Woreda, Arba Minch, Dambiro, Hula, Goro, Guraferda, Hana, Kola, Kuntu, Sador, Shakiso, Tullu Demji, and Yirgalem. These woredas together comprise an area of 60,990 square kilometers. According to the 2007 national census, the Sidama zone has a population of 3,182,376.\n\nThe Sidama Liberation Front (SLF) emerged in 1980 as a secessionist movement for the Sidama people. By 1990, the Sidama zone had become a stronghold of the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which was then the leading political organization in Ethiopia. The TPLF then moved to centralize power in Addis Ababa, the country's capital, which increased tensions with the SLF. In 1995, the SLF began an insurgency.\n\nThe government of Ethiopia responded by launching a military campaign against the SLF. The Ethiopian Ministry of Defence claims that by 2001, the security situation in the south had \"improved significantly\", and that \"the Sidama Liberation Front (SLF) has been completely disarmed and disbanded\". After the conclusion of the conflict, a number of Sidama elders pushed for the Sidama zone to become a fully fledged region of Ethiopia.\n\nIn 2010, the Sidama Liberation Front signed a peace agreement with the government of Ethiopia. The agreement provided for the formation of the Sidama Regional State, and for the Sidama to be governed by a prime minister. On 25 April 2016, the Sidama People's Democratic Front (SPDF) established the Sidama Regional State, which was endorsed by the Ethiopian parliament (house of people's representatives) on 17 June 2016. The Sidama Regional State comprises the 26 woredas of the Sidama zone.\n\nThe proposed boundary of the Sidama Republic based on the referendum results.\n\nOn 27 January 2019, an attempt at a referendum on the status of the Sidama Regional State was called off, due to demonstrations by students and opposition groups, as well as a boycott by the National Movement of Amhara. Following these protests, the Ethiopian parliament decided to postpone the referendum indefinitely.\n\nHowever, on 6 February 2023, the Sidama Regional State held a referendum, asking residents of the region if they wanted to secede from Ethiopia and form a new republic. According to preliminary results, more than 99% of voters participated, with the vast majority supporting the formation of the Sidama Republic.\n\nThe Ethiopian government declared the referendum a success, and Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed praised the people of Sidama for their \"demonstration of peaceful self-determination\".\n\nThe new Sidama Republic is expected to be the 13th region of Ethiopia. However, it is not yet clear when the Sidama Republic will fully replace the Sidama Regional State.\n\nThe referendum was marred by reports of violence and irregularities.

In some areas, up to 99.9% voted \"yes\". The opposition accuses the government of Tamret of stuffing the ballot box.\n\nThe federal election commission is supposed to process the results within two months.\n\nThe referendum and the subsequent division of zones would pave the way for more autonomy for the southern states and the creation of six new states.\n\nThe referendum will be followed by a vote within 30 days to decide which of the proposed states the zones will be a part of. The states will then go to parliament to be approved.\n\nIf the states are approved, it will pave the way for the creation of three new states and will lead to significant political changes. These are expected to lead to improvements in the areas of education, health, and economic development in the south. Following the referendum, the country will be divided into ten states.\n\nThe referendum will usher in changes in the political, economic and social spheres of the country.

There was no evidence of community transmission at that time.\nBut now the situation is changing. According to the World Health Organization, there have been 606 confirmed cases and 60 deaths as of March 22. Testing remains a challenge, and there are concerns that the true number of cases is much higher.\n\u201cThe spread of COVID-19 in Sudan has been accelerated by inadequate testing capacity, lack of access to personal protective equipment, and a significant number of suspected cases in overburdened health facilities,\u201d the World Health Organization said in a statement.\nThe crisis at the laboratory is a major setback for the country\u2019s efforts to combat the pandemic, as well as the ongoing outbreak of Ebola in the region. Sudan\u2019s health system is already heavily strained, and the shutdown of the laboratory will only make matters worse.\nThe Sudanese people need urgent support to address the COVID-19 pandemic and the Ebola outbreak.

This includes knowing the health risks, including the risks of COVID-19, food allergies, and more. Here are four ways to keep kids safe.\nIt\u2019s almost back to school time, and parents around the world are preparing for their children to return to school. However, while the pandemic is still going on, there are other health risks that parents need to be aware of as well. We\u2019ve put together a list of four things every parent should know to keep their children safe this school year.\n1. Back to school with COVID-19\nThe pandemic is still going on, and the delta variant of COVID-19 is still circulating. It\u2019s important for parents to know that their child could get sick with COVID-19 regardless of whether they\u2019re vaccinated or not. Therefore, be sure to keep your child up to date with their vaccines. If your child is eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine, make sure they get it, whether it\u2019s a primary series or a booster. This will help protect them against not only COVID-19 but also other illnesses that could be spread in school.\nIn addition to maintaining good hand hygiene, wearing a mask and staying home when feeling unwell, parents should also ensure that their child gets the necessary immunizations to protect against other illnesses that could be spread in school. These include diseases like measles, mumps, rubella, polio, pertussis (whooping cough), and chickenpox.\n2. Pay close attention to food allergies\nFood allergies are a big issue for children, and they can be a huge source of stress for both parents and kids alike. Parents should be prepared to discuss their child\u2019s food allergies with the school and, if necessary, to prepare emergency action plans with the school. This includes knowing what substitutes are available at school, in case the child has a food allergy and cannot consume certain foods.\nParents should also provide the school with an updated list of their child\u2019s food allergies. This will help the school be prepared to respond to any emergency involving a food allergy. If your child has a food allergy, be sure to seek out professional support and guidance to help manage the situation and ensure the child\u2019s safety.\n3. Childhood injuries\nIt\u2019s always important to remember that children are not invincible. They can get injured", "output_8": "<s> A crisis at the National Public Health Laboratory in Khartoum, Sudan, started after it was seized by protesters, according to an AFP report. 300 workers in the laboratory were protesting due to unpaid wages and poor working conditions. The protests led to a power outage and the seizure of the lab located on the outskirts of the capital, the report added.\nA laboratory worker told AFP, \"We received our salaries two months late, and the situation has become unbearable, especially as we are trying to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.\" One laboratory official told the news agency, \"The situation is very difficult. We are still performing some activities, but we cannot control everything.\"\nThe laboratory, run by the Sudanese ministries of health and finance, is a key facility in the country's efforts to prevent and control infectious diseases. It is not clear how long the outages will last or what impact they will have on Sudan's ability to detect and respond to potential outbreaks.\nThe news comes as the World Health Organization (WHO) is urging countries to ramp up their efforts to detect and respond to potential coronavirus outbreaks, as the emergence of new cases in countries such as the United States, Germany, and Japan suggests the virus is spreading beyond its origin in China.\nThe WHO's emergency response chief, Michael Ryan, warned that the virus could spread \"across a number of southern European countries and into Africa\". He added that Africa had \"the capacity to detect cases and the systems to respond, but we need to ensure we can maintain those systems during this crisis.\"\nThe Sudanese authorities are reportedly providing food and accommodation to the laboratory workers during the protests. The government has also set up a task force to address the workers' grievances and ensure the continued functioning of the laboratory.\nIn a statement, the acting Minister of Health, Bader Musa, said, \"The situation is very delicate and complicated, and the ministry is trying to solve it as soon as possible.\"\nThe unrest at the laboratory could further strain Sudan's struggling health system, which is already stretched thin by the ongoing conflict in the country's peripheral regions and the coronavirus outbreak. Sudan's economy has been in turmoil since the overthrow of longtime President Omar al-Bashir in 2019, and the country is currently banking on foreign aid to stabilize its finances.\nThe laboratory crisis comes just days before Sudan is to receive $216.5 million in emergency humanitarian assistance from the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union. The aid is aimed at supporting the country's efforts to contain the coronavirus outbreak and address the ongoing humanitarian crisis.\nThe laboratory seizure also highlights the potential risks of protests and unrest in times of public health emergencies, as they can disrupt critical infrastructure and hinder efforts to respond to outbreaks. The outbreak of the coronavirus has already led to the postponement of numerous public events and gatherings in Sudan and around the world, as governments seek to contain the spread of the disease.\nAs the global death toll from the coronavirus approaches 3,000, the world is preparing for the potential spread of the virus to even more countries, including those in Africa. The Sudanese government has already implemented measures to control the spread of the disease, such as closing schools and banning public gatherings.\nHowever, the current situation at the National Public Health Laboratory in Khartoum highlights the challenges faced by governments in ensuring the continued functioning of critical public health infrastructure during times of political unrest and economic crisis.\nRelated topics: Coronavirus in Africa Coronavirus in Sudan</s>", "output_9": "<s> A crisis at the National Public Health Laboratory in Khartoum, Sudan, started after it was seized by rioting paramilitaries in late June 2019. nobody was there to control operations in the lab as it was overrun, a senior official in the Sudanese ministry of health said.

The Command Center is manned by NORAD operators and supported by the National Coordinating Center, which operates the North American Aerospace Defense System (NORAD) to protect the air sovereignty of the United States and Canada.\nThese intercepts typically occur within the first few minutes of the Su-27s entering the ADIZ, but for reasons still unknown, the Su-27s continued their flight for an additional one and a half hours, during which time they did not declare their intentions or respond to repeated warnings from NORAD.\nThe Su-27s were intercepted by two F-22A Raptor stealth fighters from the 180th Fighter Wing, located at Elmendorf-Richardson Junction, Alaska, and four F-15C fighters from the 3rd Wing, located at Elmendorf-Richardson Junction.\nThe intercept was conducted in a professional and courteous manner, with the F-22s maintaining visual contact with the Su-27s and providing cover for the F-15s. At no time did the Su-27s enter US or Canadian sovereign airspace, and given the reckless nature of their flight, the two Russian aircraft could have potentially posed a threat to civilian air traffic in the region.\nHowever, because the Su-27s did not cross the international boundary, the US and Canadian militaries were unable to take custody of the aircraft and force them to land.\nThe Biden administration has repeatedly stated its commitment to ensuring the safety of the skies over the Western Hemisphere and responding to any potential airborne threats with a range of options, from intercepts to the use of weapon systems.\nThe incident also serves as a reminder of the ongoing tensions between the United States and Russia, with the two countries still technically at war following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nIt is important to note that the Alaskan ADIZ is an extension of the Canadian ADIZ, which stretches from Quebec to Baffin Island in the Canadian Arctic. The Russian warplane was likely attempting to send a message to the West by flying near the US coastline, but it is not clear if this was coordinated with the Russian government.\nIn the wake of this incident, NORAD has reiterated its commitment to ensuring the safety of the skies over North America and continuing to monitor the activities of foreign aircraft in the ADIZ.\nThe post F-22 Stealth Jets Intercept Russian Su-27 Fighters near Alaska in a \u2018Reckless\u2019 Manner first appeared on TheDailyBanana.com.\nThe post F-22 Stealth Jets Intercept Russian Su-27 Fighters near Alaska in a \u2018Reckless\u2019 Manner appeared on TheDailyBanana.com.\nThe post F-22 Stealth Jets Intercept Russian Su-27 Fighters near Alaska in a \u2018Reckless\u2019 Manner first appeared on The Daily Banana.\nThe post F-22 Stealth Jets Intercept Russian Su-27 Fighters near Alaska in a \u2018Reckless\u2019 Manner first appeared on Morning Media News.\nThe post F-22 Stealth Jets Intercept Russian Su-27 Fighters near Alaska in a \u2018Reckless\u2019 Manner first appeared on The Bollywood Trend", "output_5": "<s> On February 11, 2023, NORAD, at the direction of the Canadian Minister of National Defence and with the support of the US Secretary of Defense, assumed the NORAD role from the United States as part of the NORAD Modernization plan. \n\nAs a consequence of this rotation, Canadian and US military leaders now assume the roles of Commander and Deputy Commander, respectively, for NORAD's operations.

It\u2019s my pleasure to be with you today. I\u2019ve been asked to talk about the Arctic and Canada\u2019s role in the Indo-Pacific region.\nFor me, this a great combination, as the Arctic is the bridge between the Indo-Pacific and North America. \u202fThe Arctic is critical to the Canadian military, and our security, as an icy highway that connects our continent to the rest of the world. \u202fThe Arctic and the Indo-Pacific are critical to our country, as partners and allies. \u202fFor me, this is the story of connections and partnerships.\nThe Arctic is at the center of the global economy, with 90% of the world\u2019s trade relying on the oceans. \u202fWith globalization, we\u2019re more connected than ever. When we see disruptions or challenges to the global order, as in the case of the Ukraine crisis, the world is drawn together to address the threats to our collective security.\nAt the same time, the Arctic has faced an increase in activity by both traditional partners and newcomers. \u202fThis includes new infrastructure and activities in the region that affect our security and the security of our partners and allies. \u202fFor example, the Russian Federation\u2019s continued military build-up and activities in the North are of concern to Canada, our allies, and our Arctic Indigenous peoples.\nAs a military, we must be ready for a range of threats and challenges in the Arctic. \u202fWe need to be ready to respond to natural disasters and other emergencies, as well as to defend and project power in the region.\nCanada\u2019s priorities in the Arctic are outlined in the Strong, Profes-sional, Secure (SPS) Defence Strategy. \u202fThe Arctic is a key focus domestically and for the Canadian military, who has prioritized Arctic capabilities and is investing in innovation and new technology.\nFor example, we are modernizing our fleet of icebreakers, which are crucial for our sovereignty, security, and economic growth. \u202fWe are also investing in new technologies like unmanned systems and robotics to help us operate more effectively in the harsh Arctic environment.\nAt NORAD, we are working with our partners to ensure the command is ready to respond to any threats in the Arctic. \u202fWe have a dedicated Arctic mission, which focuses on monitoring Canada\u2019s Arctic sovereignty and supporting national and international operations. \u202fWe\u2019re", "output_9": "<s> On February 11, 2023, NORAD, at the direction of the Canadian Minister of National Defence and the Chief of the Defence Staff, directed the Canadian Armed Forces to conduct a series of exercises designed to test the nation's readiness to operate in an Arctic environment. A Canadian Coast Guard aircraft participated in the exercises, which involved military and civilian aircraft from across the world.\nExercises like this are essential to ensure the Armed Forces are ready to respond to crises in the region and maintain sovereignty over the Arctic. The extensive air exercise is a clear sign of Canada's commitment to the region and to promoting stability and cooperation with its Arctic neighbours.\n2. The US National Snow and Ice Data Centre has reported that Arctic sea ice hit its lowest level on record in 2023. What are the implications of this for Arctic nations, including Canada?\nAs the Earth's temperature continues to rise, the Arctic region is warming at a significantly faster rate than the rest of the planet. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the Arctic could be free of ice in summer by 2040.\nThe low levels of Arctic sea ice in 2023 have far-reaching consequences for the region and beyond. Here are some of the key implications:\n1. Rapidly changing landscapes: The vanishing sea ice is transforming the Arctic landscapes, affecting animal migration patterns and altering the composition of the soil.\n2. Disruption of natural cycles: The loss of sea ice is also disrupting the natural cycles that regulate the climate, such as the albedo effect and the impact on ocean currents.\n3. Rise in sea levels: As sea ice melts and the ocean warms, the volume of the water in the ocean increases, leading to a rise in sea levels.\n4. Changes in weather patterns: The disappearance of sea ice in the Arctic could potentially impact the global weather patterns, such as influencing the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events.\n5. National security concerns: The changing Arctic environment is a matter of national security for all Arctic countries, including Canada, as it affects access to natural resources, borders, and fisheries.\n6. Biodiversity loss: The loss of Arctic sea ice is a major threat to the biodiversity of the region, with more than 100 species of animals - including polar bears, narwhals, and seals - facing extinction.\nThe decrease in Arctic sea ice is a warning sign of the urgent need to address the global climate crisis and take action to mitigate its consequences. The world must come together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit the worst impacts of climate change.\nArctic sea ice hits record-low winter maximum: CBC\nNear-record low Arctic sea ice extent in January 2023: National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC)\nCanada has sent a message to the world with its Arctic exercise this week: Maclean's\nArctic sea ice reached its lowest level on record this year: Here\u2019s why that matters: CBC\nArctic sea ice hits new record low this year: Here's what it means: CTV\nThe world is running out of ice and time to curb emissions: The Washington Post\nThis week, we asked: What was the Arctic Expedition of 1845 and what relevance does it hold today?\nThe Arctic Expedition of 1845 refers to a journey undertaken by Sir John Franklin and his crew aboard the HMS Erebus and HMS Terror. They set sail from England in 1845 with the goal of charting the Northwest Passage, a sea route connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans through the Arctic. The expedition was abandoned in 1848 when both ships became trapped in ice and the crews were unable to reach safety.\nThe relevance of the Arctic Expedition of 1845 to today's world is that it serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of Arctic exploration. Despite advances in technology and knowledge, the perils of the polar region remain immense, and the challenges of operating in the Arctic are still not fully understood. Recent search expeditions have highlighted the continuing mystery surrounding the fate of Franklin and his crew, and the need for greater cooperation and preparedness in Arctic exploration.\n1.
