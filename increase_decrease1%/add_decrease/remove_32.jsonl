He can appear to you in a dream, giving you advice, a helping hand, or reassurance. Father figures in dreams can be symbols of wisdom, protection, guidance, and unconditional love. Your father's appearance in a dream may signify that you are seeking guidance and acceptance from someone who knows you better than anyone else. This person may be someone who has been a mentor or guide throughout your life, such as a parent or teacher.\nIf the father figure is absent or has disappeared from your life, it may indicate that you are feeling disconnected or disconnected from those who provide nurturing and support. The presence of a father figure in a dream may also represent your need to take charge of your own life and make decisions based on what's important to you.\nDreaming about your Father or someone who represents Fatherly qualities can be a sign of your need for protection, support, and guidance. Your subconscious is urging you to consider important aspects of your life and make decisions based on what matters most to you. If you're uncertain about the best course of action, your Father figure in a dream may encourage you to listen to your intuition and trust your inner guidance. Dreaming about your Father could also indicate that you need to take care of yourself and put your own needs first in order to achieve optimal growth.\nDreaming of a fatherly figure might also point to an aspect of yourself that requires care and attention. This could manifest as an aspect of your emotional wellbeing, physical wellbeing, or spiritual growth that needs nurturing. The presence of a fatherly figure in your dream might also be a sign that you have unresolved issues from your past that need to be addressed. The symbols in your dream may reveal how to move forward and make decisions that will improve your life.\nThe significance of a father figure can vary depending on the context of the dream and your personal experiences with that figure. Dreaming of a fatherly figure could be a sign of your desire for guidance, protection, and support in your waking life. Alternatively, it could be a call to focus on your own needs or heal past wounds from your relationship with your father. The symbols in your dream can provide insight into how to move forward and take control of your life.\nIn dream interpretation, understanding the father as a symbol can be complicated due to the emotional association many people have with their fathers. The dream may be trying to communicate something specific about your situation, but the context and personal meaning behind the specific father in your dream will require interpretation. It's important to pay attention to the details, such as the emotions or actions you experienced while dreaming, and the feelings you experienced when you woke up. These clues can help you understand what the dream is trying to reveal and how that applies to your current situation or perspective on life.\nIncorporating a fatherly figure into your dream can help to reveal aspects of your identity that you may not be aware of. The presence of a fatherly figure can often represent stability, guidance, and protection during difficult times. Dreaming of a fatherly figure can be a powerful reminder to focus on your emotional well-being and seek out guidance from those who have your best interests in mind.\nOverall, incorporating a fatherly figure into your dream can provide a deeper understanding of yourself and your emotional needs. If you are experiencing stress or uncertainty, dreaming of a fatherly figure may be a signal to seek out support and guidance from those who care about you and can offer you the wisdom and perspective you need. The father figure can also act as a symbol of wisdom, guidance, and protection while navigating through difficult life circumstances.\nThe dream can be a powerful tool for self-reflection and growth, as it can reveal unconscious motivations and thought patterns that may not be immediately obvious in real life. Dreaming about a father can evoke emotions such as love, pride, respect, guilt, and fear. It can reveal unmet desires or goals that need to be addressed, as well as relationships that may need more work. The father figure can also serve as a mirror for the dreamer, reflecting back what they need to work on, both emotionally and mentally.\nThe presence of your father in a dream can mean different things depending on the context, your current emotional state, and your personal history with him.

But the trauma he went though took a toll on him and he never truly recovered.\nThey stayed in the hospital for several hours and once Ricky was okay and was given a restful nap, they sat at the table with some food and tea.

When they got out of the hospital Ricky wasnt as happy.\n\"Don't make me sorry\", he would scream at night. \"How could I forget something that could happen to me?\" They gave what they could to him to make him better, but the pain of the accident kept him sad. \"Mom, Dad i don't know what to do.\"\nWhen Christmas came, they would get gifts for Ricky, but Natalie knew that Ricky would never be all right.\n\"Mom,Dad, I love you so much I don't know how you are with me gone.

The question has two elements: 1. For the first element, a sample needs a random sample.\nWas I right with my answer to the 3rd question?\nIf not, what is the right answer?\nYou were correct about the first two questions.\nFor the third question, you do need to random sample from the group of potential voters. In particular, you're going to need to know how many voters are in the group.\nIf 100 people in the group show up at a rally, you can assume that those people will vote for the candidate. On the night of the rally, the candidate visits only 10 voters.\nHow can you randomly pick 10 who will definitely vote for the candidate?\nPick 10 from each category, and keep doing this until you've covered the entire group. This will ensure that you have a random sample (it will have a known size, so is not technically \"random\" by strict definition).\nCan you explain to me how to pick 10, how does it work with 50 random or 100 random?\nYou pick the first person from your list, and check if the candidate visited her. If no, you've taken care of one person from the group of 100. You pick the next person, and check if she was visited. Continue until you find a person who was visited, and you keep her. Then you move on to the first name on the list again.\nThis is how random sampling from a list works.\nWhat if you had a sample of 20 out of the 100 and found that 16 voted? What is the liklihood that the whole 100 voted?\nThis is what we call hypothesis testing. I'd need to know the probability that you would have found 16 or more (assuming your sample is a random sample).\nIf the probability is small, this gives support for a claim that the whole group might have voted this way. If the probability is higher, this might indicate that you picked the wrong 16 in the list.\nYou can use statistics to figure out the probability of finding at least 16 true, given your sample size of 20.\nThank you for helping. So I am not to worry about statistics, and just worry about my answer?\nYes, not too much to do here. If you are going for easy points this semester, you should have no trouble getting the grade you want.\nI do have 1 more question if you don't mind. I get the idea of using the statistic, and the confidence levels to figure it out, but I am still struggling a little with it. How do we arrive at a figure for the number of visits needed in order to find the 16 (or whatever is high enough to make us think the truth is correct)?\nIf the confidence level were 95%, this means that there is a 96% chance you'll find at least 16 visitors from the list. This tells you that there only 1 out 20 people (5%) who weren't visited would be the cause for your finding that 16 are supporters of the candidate.\nSo the number of surveys to do depends on how you decide on your confidence probability. 5%, for example, would need 20 surveys.\nThis, however, all depends on whether you want to calculate the confidence probability. Some professors simply accept whatever the students propose for the confidence levels, without requiring any work from the students.\nMy professor says he wants to know the level of confidence, but if I just need to make a high enough percentage correct in the survey, that would make sense wouldn't it?\nYes, if you're required to do an hypothesis test, it would be OK to choose whatever confidence probability you needed in order to confirm your result.</s>", "output_4": "<s> She knew that her dad, John, was an eecutiv, working hard to make impotant dcisions in his company,and he mom, Emma, was busy working full-time.

You can also choose to write a story that is solely based on dialogue, or you can write a story that is partially based on action. The important thing is to find the right technique for you, and to use it to tell the story that you want to tell.\nThere are a variety of different methods for writing a story.

And so did his sister, who was also a workaholic.\nHowever, this was largely due to the stress of her work, and to their different values. As a result, the relationship between Kevin and David was strained, and David ultimately left the marriage. Fortunately, their split was amicable.\nKevin\u2019s relationship with David was complicated, but it did ultimately manage to stay on track. While he admitted that working with your best friend can be challenging, he maintained that it could also be very rewarding.\nWhile this may have been true for Kevin and David, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that everyone else can have a similarly positive experience. After all, not all friendships work out as planned. So is it really possible to remain friends with your ex-best friend following an amicable breakup?\nThe short answer is yes, but only if both parties are willing to put in the effort.\nKevin\u2019s experience proved that it\u2019s possible to maintain a close relationship with an ex-best friend when both parties are willing to put in the work. In fact, many people report that working through difficult times can actually strengthen their bond. And, in some cases, that bond can last long after the friendship has ended.\nSo the question you should be asking is: Can I really stay friends with my ex-best friend, and if so, how? Well, the answer is yes, but it will take a lot of work on both your parts. Here are some tips to help you stay friends with your ex-best friend following an amicable breakup:\nIt can be tough to go into a breakdown with your buddy, especially if you\u2019re not completely over them. After all, they could still be a part of your life, and it\u2019s hard to leave them behind. But if you want to be able to stay friends with your ex-best friend following an amicable breakup, then you\u2019ll need to be able to break down some walls.\nBecause they likely won\u2019t just go away on their own. Once they\u2019re gone, it can be hard to rebuild the relationship, and it can be even harder if you\u2019re not willing to confront the issues that led to the breakup. So the next time you find yourself in a situation where you want to break down a wall with your ex-best friend, go for it! Talk to them, explain what\u2019s going on, and try to work things out. If things don\u2019t work out, at least you\u2019ll have tried and won\u2019t regret not doing anything at all.\nKeep an open dialogue\nAfter an amicable breakup with an ex-best friend, it can be hard to stay connected. This is understandable, as there are likely to be a lot of hurt feelings and emotions. However, if you want to remain friends with your ex-best friend after the break-up, it\u2019s important that you keep an open dialogue. This means being honest and open with them about your feelings and emotions.\nIt\u2019s also important to be patient in these conversations. There may be many different things that you need to say, and the conversation may take some time. However, it\u2019s important to keep talking, even if it means going over topics more than one time. Keeping these conversations positive and healthy will help you maintain a good relationship with your ex-best friend, even after the amicable breakup.\nThere is no guaranteed way that this will happen, but if you are able to stay close with your ex-best friend even after an amicable breakup, it is likely that they will have a close relationship with you. However, keep in mind that not everyone is compatible with their ex-best friend and it may take some time to build up the relationship.\nIf you find that your relationship with your ex-best friend is not as strong as it once was, you can try making some changes such as avoiding certain conversations or taking a break from seeing them. However, if you do decide to end your relationship with your ex-best friend, it is important to explain why and how you feel about the situation before making any decisions regarding their future with you.\nKeep in mind that staying friends with an ex-best friend following an amicable breakup can be complicated and take time and effort. However, if you both want to remain close, it is worth it to try. Just remember\nAfter an amicable break-up, it\u2019", "output_6": "<s> es got a bit f atemper rod his amily.

Thoughgenerally cal, ke canget frustratedih tose closest to him, especially when he's overreliant on his son. The one redeeming quality in Wakefield is Amy, the beautiful and loving wife who lives with her husband without ever being able to tell her kids her feelings about the decision that she and Martin made years ago. She's completely accepting of her son and doesn't find him a threat in her husband's mind. Amy has a heart of gold, and is the most loyal of all characters. Unfortunately, Amy seems to lack any true backbone. She's passive, submissive and never sticks up for herself, which would be fine if she had some self-esteem or character. Unfortunately, Amy thinks her husband is wonderful, and sees through his deceit and manipulation without any problem. Her ability to forgive Martin time and time again is one of the largest sources of frustration with me as a viewer. Amy never stands up to him, and instead takes everything that he dishes out with no retaliation whatsoever. This is not a positive quality in a wife, and Amy's only other significant redeeming quality is her empathy and kindness to Martin's children in place of her own. Martin's children aren't exactly well-rounded characters, either. Lilly is the most well-rounded and is an interesting and complex character who is not only beautiful but extremely intelligent, strong in her own rights, and a fighter. She's the most independent of Martin's children and, unfortunately, is only in the family due to Martin's mistake. On the other hand, Wakefield's other daughter, Amy, is a complete blank. She's not a good student, she has no real interests, and simply follows her father around like a lost puppy. She has no life goals, and spends all of her time with her father. It is clear that there is no real relationship between Martin and his children, and this is one of the larger issues with them as characters. Though I do feel that there are some interesting points about the family dynamic in Wakefield, it is not enough to make this movie worth watching. The characters feel so unbelievable that the story falls apart. There is no real development and no real connection between the characters. I can't recommend this movie, as it is just not worth the time.\"\n\"2. Wakefield is a bit of an anomaly in the way that it deals with the main character's mental illness. It is rare to come across a movie that approaches the topic of mental health in such a respectful and sensitive manner, and the film does an incredible job of balancing the often serious nature of the illness with an equally serious examination of the characters that are affected by the illness. Wakefield is a great example of how the film industry can tackle such a sensitive topic without sacrificing the characters' humanity, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to learn more about mental health and the stigma that comes with it.\"\n\"The Wakefield family is an excellent movie that has a good story and characters. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes family movies.\"\n- by AJ\n\"Wakefield is a great movie. It deals with tough topics and is very insightful. I recommend watching this movie if you want to learn more about mental health and humanity.\"\n\"Wakefield is a great movie. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to feel better about themselves. It is a beautiful movie that deals with heavy topics in a way that makes them worth watching. I would love to watch Wakefield again.\"\n\"I really liked the movie the Wakefled. This is a great movie with a great plot. This is one of those movies that you don't want to miss.\"\n- by David Keller\n\"If you like family movies, then this is for you. The Wakefield family is an amazing group of people that I recommend checking out. This movie is about a family that has been separated for years, but they reunite and they go on an adventure. This is a great family movie that I believe anyone would enjoy. It's about family and friendship, and how important it is to have both. I think this movie is a great one for kids and adults, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to see a great family movie. This movie is a great movie to watch, and I hope that you enjoy it as much as I did.

How many times had she been told to be strong, for the good of the family She didn t know, but every time he called her strong, she felt a little weak and tired. The reason why his mother didn t talk about it was because of such a reason.\nAs a descendant of the Lewis family, one of the most powerful families in the empire, Lily was well informed, and it was precisely because of the strength that she had to sacrifice the happiness of the family members. The people in his family always emphasized individual ability and not the weaknesses in the group. She looked at the house in front of her, at the people who called her a fighter and said that they could bear the hardships of the entire family, but she just knew that this did not mean that they had made their own choices to accept them.\nShe also knew what it means, but she was still waiting. She knew she would not be able to get the same words from the lips of her mother, who said she could do it, but not from her. If it was up to his mother, she would have been killed for such an attitude, and perhaps they would have never met again for the rest of their lives. This attitude was the best proof of the mother s love for her, how selfless she was.\nThis had happened before, which had already caused her injury and had to undergo medical treatment, otherwise, she would have died. For her, what did she have If this family was to kill all its descendants, then even she would just become another weak link. However, when everything was said and done, there was still one thing left to do, which was to prove to those he killed that she was still alive. He did not say it yet, and his eyes were bright.\nAnd my father, my mother, and all the members of the house of the Lewis family, they are all dead. I knew it. I also knew that these were all tricks, but I still couldn t help not admiring it. I knew that when it was time, he would still say that it was nothing, when he saw those dead faces every day, if he did not, then he would live with them and would not survive. It was not his business to question whether he was right or not. After all, it was their belief and he did not have the right to interfere with such a matter Lily had long been prepared.\nShe already knew. She knew that one of the sons of the Lewis family had killed all the other members of the Lewis family, including her mother. They did not have a choice, it was them who were too weak, and in the end, weakness was just another word for death. The other brother was not much older than her, but in her memory, he was a stubborn child but he was always so young and strong But Lily had long since chosen to not mention him. She knew, and for her, there was only one thing left to do, and that was to save herself. He saw the little girl in front of him, her eyes were always dark and there was always a trace of exhaustion hanging over her face.\nThis wasn t what he wanted to see, but at that moment, he knew that she would not let go of her anger against the Lewis family, no matter what he wanted. They wanted to protect her, not to mention the fact that she was the first born, but because she had already taken control of her feelings, nothing could make her sad.\n"}

A decade before that,their list of high-majors was far more impressive - 10 in an 11-year period. They are now down to one. Tennessee was on such a roll because they could recruit players out of state at a time when other schools could not n still could not, though that was much less ofan issue a decade ago, when there were less than half the number of women's basketball schools at any level.\nThe Vols added two high-majors to their roster in 2008-09, and n another reason why they will have such a good shot at getting Lewis is they are in the position ofn other schools who've nlled their recruiting classes lately,n which they won't likely have spots open for 2011-12.\nTennessee played n the championship game of th e Final Four last season, and then in early December,the program announced the return of former assistant coach Pat Summitt - who is also the school's women's\nTennessee played n the championship game of th e Final Four last season, and then in early December,the program announced the return of former assistant coach Pat Summitt - who is also the school's women's.\nThose are both huge reasons Lewis should put Tennessee on her short list n possibly commit to coach. n addition,the Vols have been on a roll while Lewis has been on the court - including th etopmost spot in the preseason AP poll.\nLewis, who has already made the rounds with Vols staff n would have no problem fitting in on Rocky Top,doesn't have to play for a winner. She,just like everyone else who has ever played basketball or any other sport,is in it to make herself a player.

That\u2019s where you come in.\nSince then, I\u2019ve written two more full-length novels and one series of short stories, all under the pen name of Jane Harvey. If you\u2019ve followed me, you may have known me as Meryn Leah in the past. So did I. And at some point I realized that if I was going to continue writing novels under a \u201cbrand-safe\u201d name like Jane Harvey, it simply wasn\u2019t going to cut it. I had an epiphany: people would be able to recognize that I\u2019m writing these books, so I should probably use the name that made those books known in the first place.\nSo, starting immediately, you can now buy all of my novels from the Jane Harvey name. In the next few months I plan on re-publishing older books to make them consistent with the same pen name. The Last Ones was the first, and now it\u2019s finally The Last One and in keeping with my new name. To celebrate, I am putting my newest novel, a paranormal romance novel, in the 3rd slot with a FREE price.

It also highlights concerns regarding the lack of accountability and transparency in the formation of the new state, and calls for those responsible for the violations to be held accountable.\nThe report identifies a number of shortcomings regarding the ongoing human rights monitoring and reporting in Hadiya, including the lack of a dedicated hotline or complaint mechanism for citizens to report human rights violations, as well as concerns about the capacity of local authorities to conduct effective investigations into allegations of violations. The report recommends that the government take steps to establish an independent complaints mechanism and to ensure that human rights violations are thoroughly investigated and prosecuted.\nThe report emphasizes the importance of strengthening the rule of law in Hadiya and called for the establishment of an independent and effective judiciary, as well as the adoption of laws and policies that protect and promote human rights.\nKEMBA TEMBARO RECOMMENDATIONS\nThe EHRC report on Kemba Tembaro highlights a number of concerns and recommends steps to address the ongoing human rights violations in the region:\nLack of accountability for past human rights violations during the referendum: The report notes that there has been a lack of accountability for human rights violations committed during the referendum, including killings, arbitrary arrests, and torture. A lack of investigation and prosecution has allowed perpetrators to escape justice, further perpetuating a culture of impunity.\nInadequate investigation into allegations of abuses: The report finds that the ongoing investigations into allegations of human rights violations have been inadequate and lack transparency. It recommends that the government establish an independent and effective investigation mechanism to address these concerns.\nInadequate support for victims of abuses: The report notes that victims of human rights violations have not received adequate support, both in terms of medical care and financial assistance. It recommends that the government provide appropriate support and compensation for victims.\nNeed for greater awareness and training on human rights: The report highlights the need for greater awareness of human rights in the region, particularly among state and local officials. It recommends that the government prioritize training and capacity-building efforts to promote respect for human rights.\nLack of consultative process for the new local administration: The report notes that there has been limited consultation with the public on the formation of the new local administration. It recommends that the government engage in a more inclusive and consultative process to ensure that the new administration is responsive to the needs and concerns of the population.\nSHEKA RECOMMENDATIONS\nThe report identifies a number of human rights concerns in Sheka and recommends measures to address these concerns:\nViolations of the right to freedom of expression: The report highlights cases of harassment, intimidation, and arbitrary arrests of people who peacefully exercised their rights to express their opinions and protest against the government. It recommends adopting laws that would protect these rights and ensuring that security forces act in a manner that promotes and preserves these rights.\nAbuse of power of local administration: The report finds that local authorities have been using their power to suppress dissent and violate people's human rights.

Gamo zone has not voted to join Sidama by more than 70%.The same was true in Souh and Wellega Zones as well. They all voted to remain in Oromia. The referendum was not conducted in Gura Ferda.\nThe Sidama zone with population of 1.9 million voted to join the newly created Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People\u2019s Region (SNNPR) by a 98.8 per cent, of the vote according to EHNN (Ethiopia Human Rights Commission). The ruling party the TPLF conducted the referendum in its traditional ruthless way with its usual inhumane and unlawful ways which was the case in all other referendums it was involved in the past years. In Gomma zone(Guraghe region) 54.7% voted in favor of the proposed administrative structure to join Oromo, and also in the Metekel part of the Amhara region 54.7% voted to join Oromo.\nThe referendum was conducted and the result announced on the 22nd of November, 2023. So far no official body released any result apart from EHNN. Therefore what are the facts?\nAs a result of the referendum a new country or region has been created. With the recent referendum in Tigray, Oromia and Amhara has become 3 independent regions from the former state of Ethiopia.\nOromia State has been subdivided into two regions namely Oromo state and Bale State. Gomma zone which comprise of Guraghe, Hosgoro, and Guji zone has also become its own region. Gomma zone had no other option or choice. There are 6 zones in Oromiya state which had their own referendum on their own zones.\nGomma and Bale zones which voted to be part of Oromiya state are surrounded by neighboring state of South Nations, Nationalities, and People\u2019s Region (SNNPR) which was created by the minority regime. There have been lots of complaints about the region. These are due to human right violations, oppression, and killings carried out by the TPLF regime in Oromiya State.\nThe newly born region of Bale state was created by dividing Bale zone which was formed after a referendum in 2020. Bale state had a population of 1,9 million souls and the population of Gomma zone is about 5,6 million, which is the second population in the region. The total population of the new Oromo region is about 8.6 million of which Gomma zone has roughly 2 million people (32%).\nHow does Gomma become a new region and why did Bale state separate from it to become the fourth region of the newly created state? The answer is to be found here. In the first place, a census carried out in 2017 showed that there are more Bale zone people than Oromo people. The Oromo people have the majority in Oromiya region but Bale had 58% of the population. Therefore, the Amhara people who occupy Gomma zone were incorporated into Bale state so that Amharas do not become a majority in the region. The new Bale state has a total population of 4.2 million of whom Amhara has only 1 million (23%). This could explain the situation: Gomma remained Oromiya state\u2019s third region with a population of more than 3 million Amharas but Gomma was incorporated into the newly created Bale state to prevent the Amhara becoming a majority in the region.\nThe ruling party is against the creation of the new region and they are angry about the recent referendum. Therefore, they have started calling them \u201cMafia and terrorist groups\u201d, and the creation of the new region has been declared null and void by the federal government.

These referendum came unexpectedly for the majority of the people especially for young people, and many people were not familiar to the politics. But, the main reason behind the instability of these regions is the politics and governance of these regions.\nReferendum are political manoeuvre that have their roots in the politics of the countries or regions. Politicians who are in power, in government or in the parliament have no political accountability. The most effective political accountability mechanism is political competition through the transfer of power in the form of electoral mandate. Democracies ensure electoral mandate through a competition mechanism in which the people decide their future leadership through free and fair elections. It has been proved that people should be given the opportunity to choose their future leadership through free and fair elections, as they are better decision-maker of their own future.\nThere was no any political discussion within the community, the communities do not play any role for the political dialogue or negotiation among political actors\u2026 Most of the elders who are leaders of the communities were in prison or fled for their lives for being against the government. Young people, university students who have a great potential are on the street fighting for their rights and dreams. These regions were destroyed and demolished because of the bad governance and the bad politics of the regions and all what happen during Meles regime and the political and security situations in the regions\u2026\nUnfortunately, the people of these regions are not prepared for the referendum, that it was the time to elect their future leaders and shape their future. Many young people didn\u2019t participate on the referendum in addition to many people who were not registered, they want also to participate and have the chance to elect their future leaders and leaders of their future. The referendum is the most important political dialogue or negotiation as a future political dialogue between the people of the regions who elect their future leader or future leaders. The referendum will determine whether the people are happy and satisfied with the regions or not, and this is what matters\u2026\nThe referendum should have been planned through a political dialogue or political negotiation among political actors which include all elders of the community and their representatives for their future political development for their children future in their regions. The regional governments and the central government of Oromia should have invited political actors and the elders of the community and given them an opportunity to discuss their future political development and choose their future leaders through free and fair elections. The elders of these communities should have been involved in political dialogue and political negotiations. These communities, regions, and society need peace and democracy.\nThis is the right time for the people of these regions to choose their future leaders through free and fair elctions. The people should make sure that the referendum is the last and final political dialogue or political negotiation for their future political development. They will write their history and make sure whether they have a future to the next generation or not\u2026\nReferendum in these regions is a decision to elect future leaders of these communities and regions who will decide their future political development. Unfortunately, the future political leaders and the people will have no choice, and these referendum will be only a time-wasting exercise. On this basis, I want to clarify that the future of these political leaders and the rest of the people of these regions will be theirs.\nIt is my plea to all political actors especially the regional government and the central government of Oromia. The government of Oromia, as the regional government, should not do the politics or any political manoeuvre for their political development. The referendum is the most expensive and political costly exercise for the people and the community. It has never helped many communities before in political dialogue or political negotiation.

On August 2020 the referendum was conducted in two areas of the Welaita and Gamo zones of the SNNR, to see the demand by the SNNP to be divided into three regional states and to leave the country. According to the EAC, the regions of Gamo and Welaita will be federated with Southern Nation and the Oromo region, after a period of three years. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvQ60J4DsM)\nThese referendums come at a time when Ethiopia goes through the most fundamental change in its history both in political, social and economic matters. Ethiopians are faced with this huge challenge of the nation building process. Therefore the time for the referendums is neither politically appropriate for the peace of the country nor socially or psychologically acceptable by the people.\nReferendum and the concept of nation-building:\nIdeally, a nation-state is formed by a nation (or, a people), as they identify themselves with mutuality of interests, culture, ethnicity, nationality and values of the nation (people). Referendum, however, is not about the creation of such mutual of interests, culture, ethnicity, nationality and values of the nation. It is rather an act of diving the nation into different nations. Consequently, it tends to create a lot of problems for the unity, peace and stability. Referendum, therefore, cannot be accepted as a nation-building concept.\nNation building is essentially a product of the nation (people), where a nation builds itself through consensus-making and agrees on what defines and represents their collective identity. The nation-building process is a journey from the grassroots to the top. It begins long before a formal referendum is put before the people. It starts from the process of democratic dialogue with equal respect to all opinions and differences. The spirit of nation building is, however, contrary to the spirit of referendums.\nReferendum, however, cannot be accepted as a nation-building concept because it aims for the separation of a nation into different nations (ethnic groups). It aims to divide rather than to unite the people. In this regards, it creates unnecessary problems and makes the nation to be weak by splitting into different nations (ethnic groups). It also is a very sensitive process of change. It takes a strong man with solid political will the vision to make it successful.\nReferendum and the statehood:\nIn essence, the statehood is nothing other than a constitution, which defines the identity, political system and boundaries of the nation, within its constitutional borders. When the existing government is elected by the people, who identify themselves as one people (nation), then the legitimacy is already established. The constitution, however, may allow certain regions to secede, like in the US and Canada for example. This may be appropriate if the people so choose. There is no other way around it. Therefore, the referendums in Ethiopia have no legality and constitutional basis to be conducted at a time when the country is at such an ethno-political cross-road.\nA referendum is neither about the creation of such mutuality of interests, the values of ethnic groups or the identities, cultures, language and ethnicity of these ethnic groups among each other. On the contrary, it is about the division of the nation into a multiplicity of different nations or ethnicities. It is a vote for divide and not for unity. Therefore it cannot be included within Ethiopian federal constitutional democratic order. If Ethiopia is not a federation, it should be made a nation state. If Ethiopia is a federation, then it should be the sovereign of the people and the nation in order to be in a position to decide on the status of these regions, not a referendum.\nReferendums and international law:\nThe United Nations was born a nation of nations in the hope and aim of peaceful existence. However, the international law allows every nation a sovereign right to decide the constitutional future of the nation, within its international borders without being controlled by any other nation. Referendums for example the United Kingdom\u2019s decision to leave the European Union, was, therefore, totally appropriate within international law. It was legally rightfully decided by the people who defined the mutual interests and cultures of the UK as well as Europe. Furthermore, the UN is currently under reviewing any form", "output_9": "<s> On February 2023 a referendum wa hel i the Wolayita, Gamo, Gofa, Souh Omo and Somali regional state.

While initial attempts at ransom or release were being negotiated, the 22 remaining civilian staff were moved by SLA/M to different locations for their protection. Eventually nine of those employees were released to the staff of the Sudan Democracy First Group (SDFG). By the middle of 1996, negotiations for the release of the remaining workers were progressing satisfactorily; three remaining staff members had been exchanged in April 1996, and all 22 were officially released in July 1996.\nAt the time of their capture and in the following months, the staff faced the risk of being tortured, used as human shields, or arbitrarily killed.\nTorment, imprisonment, torture, execution: in recent months thousands of people have been subjected to just these horrors in Sudan.\nWhilst the world's spotlight has focused on Darfur and its 200,000 death toll since, the crisis hasn't abated in the rest of Sudan, a country which is also facing ongoing internal conflict.\nIn 2019 alone, the African Crisis Group reported the deaths of over 1,800 people in Southern Kordofan, Blue Nile, Unity and South Darfur. They were killed by the country's army, which has responded to rebel attacks with widespread indiscriminate violence.\nIn the south, the war broke out with the secession of South Sudan in 2011, which is when Sudanese armed groups were drawn from Darfur and forced to fight to defend the north - even if this has meant the use of child and foreign recruits.\nIn 2018 alone, the United Nations recorded 24 attacks on medical facilities, clinics, health workers and transports in the country - with over a hundred casualties caused by fighting between the Sudanese military government, insurgents and the civilian population.\nThe world's spotlight has focused on Darfur, but in Sudan itself, people are still dying\nWhilst in Darfur civilians are targeted, those in the rest of the country cannot be guaranteed protection - those in conflict zones, such as South Kordofan, or in the conflict along the borders, in Blue Nile.\nWithin the camps, women and girls are at risk of sexual assault - including those displaced for decades and who are already malnourished.\n\"It is heartbreaking to see mothers and children being abused, harassed and even worse things, because of the ongoing conflict,\" said one humanitarian worker involved in a project in Sudan.\nThe number of people uprooted is staggering: in southern Kordofan, it is estimated there are 2.1 million refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs).\nAs recently as the past few weeks, two IDPs were buried - shot, with a Sudanese refugee woman in the Democratic Republic of Congo allegedly giving birth in an attempt to prevent the birth and prevent the child being abducted by the group that killed her husband.\nThis is the third person to die in the Congolese refugee camp since the army of the group called 'Janjaweed', from the area near Darfur, invaded the camp in the early hours of September 29 - with reports of three deaths.\nJanjaweed is a term used to refer to a group of Arabs that terrorize the civilian population of Darfur, where they committed atrocities such as torture, ethnic cleansing, and rape.\nTheir actions and the fighting they carried out contributed directly to the International Criminal Court's decision to indict the former leader of the group, Janjawid Ahmad al-Faqi, on charges of crimes against humanity.\nIn 2011, Khartoum and Darfur witnessed the beginning of what experts believe is one of the worst humanitarian crises of our time, namely a \"man-made\" one.\nArab tribes, referred to as Janjiya, began attacking the local civilian population, displacing them and creating a humanitarian crisis that resulted in the deaths of 300,000 people and the displacement of 2.5 million people.\nThe situation is similar today: the Janjaweed is an Arab milit", "output_1": "<s> A crisis at the National Pubc Healtaboratory i Khartum, Sudan, trted after was seized by rebels and was then torsted.\nIn the wake of the attacks on the NPHM and on a number of the Sudanese government's military centers in the outskirts of Khartoum, a large number of employees were killed or injured, including Sudanese technicians themselves who were trying to protect vital facilities.\nThere was a report of looting and the destruction of medical stores and medicines. Many essential pieces of medical equipment were destroyed, including incubators, vital scientific equipment, and sophisticated medical and laboratory supplies, which will cause a major delay in the restoration of their functions.\nIn the wake of the terrorist attacks on vital institutions in Khartoum, the Sudanese Ministry of Health has taken emergency steps for the preservation of blood and the storage of blood supplies in blood banks and health centers in the various states, in line with governmental directives to minimize the impact of the attack on health institutions and the delivery of health services to citizens.\nThese steps included the establishment of special emergency units in more than one state, to ensure the safety of blood banks and to prevent the spread of diseases.\nThe Ministry of Health in the Republic of Sudan urges all blood donors, as the most noble and effective humanitarian act, to donate blood in support of the victims of terrorist attacks, and the governmental and private bodies are coordinating their efforts to ensure the speedy provision of all necessary medical supplies to meet the needs of the injured for treatment and rehabilitation.\nThe Ministry is also working to enhance cooperation with the NPHM in the field of blood safety, quality management, and vaccination, given the importance of these institutions for the health and well-being of citizens.\nThe NPHM, in return, expressed its solidarity with the Ministry of Health in light of the difficult conditions it is going through, and reiterated its readiness to provide any technical support, assistance, and advice that the Ministry may need.

The samples are destroyed within hours of their arrival, due to lack of refrigeration.\nBut the Sudanese government has not only attempted to take over and destroy private laboratories, it also has stopped their activities altogether in Darfur.\nNatalie Moregan, a researcher in London working on the political implications of Sudanese refugees, was forced to end a series of healthcare and development projects earlier this year after she was refused renewal of her visa. \u201cWe had to leave in a hurry. Everything in our apartment had to be left behind, including our personal lives.\u201d\n\u201cI was told that I couldn\u2019t have the visa renewed because we were working with the opposition, the Sudan Liberation Army. I couldn\u2019t believe what was happening because I was just a small researcher working on small projects for the government,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t do development work in Darfur without knowing if you can have your visa renewed. We just kept the projects going because we didn\u2019t want to scare people off. But when the visa issue arose, I had to quit.\u201d\nThe Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Army (SPLA) includes the SPLA-North, the main rebel group that is fighting the government in Darfur and is trying to establish an independent state there. It is not known how many Sudanese refugees have joined the Darfur-based SPLA, and its relationship with the government is contentious.\nAt least one refugee, Mohamed Osman Sidi, has been killed after he was suspected to have been an SPLA agent. His body was found on his farm near the Al Fashir refugee camps in October, a little over a month after his return from Kampala, Uganda, where his wife lived after he was displaced from his Sudanese home, along with more than 50,000 Darfuris in 1985, according to the Sudanese Defense Forces (SDF).\nWhen asked about the Sudanese government\u2019s decision to stop refugee healthcare activities, he said, \u201cWe have nothing to do with the government.

Omar al-Bashm, who fled there as his 30-year-old dictatorship collapsed in April, leaving more than 330,000 dead. The building has been badly looted and equipment badly damaged, say officials and former workers. More than 50,000 blood specimens, some contaminated, have been stored and have to be destroyed. Health workers are also fearful of diseases that may have been spread during this chaotic period.\nSudan\u2019s former president, Omar Hassan al-Bashir, has been handed a 2-year jail sentence for corruption after being convicted in a money laundering case, but he was already serving 3 consecutive life sentences under Sudan\u2019s new government. Al-Bashir fled to Khartoum last week from the towering sandstone building that served as the NIW headquarters. It had been his home since seizing power when a popular uprising erupted in 1989, and the NIW building housed several laboratories and offices. Workers described a chaotic scene of looting after he fled with several of his senior aides and many of his officials and the headquarters.\nSome of the most valuable items were taken with the government, said former NIW employees who had worked as scientists in the laboratories or as laboratory technicians. \u201cThe laboratories were totally looted,\u201d they said. \u201cAll the instruments and chemicals were taken.\u201d According to them, all the blood specimens \u2013 estimated by the World Health Organization to number more than 50,000 \u2013 have been collected and stored in cooling rooms. But the National Institute of Health Directorate, which supervises laboratories including the NIW, said on 17 January that some of the blood samples are contaminated or have expired.\nMany of the samples date to 2015 and were collected for the purpose of establishing a genetic database of Sudan\u2019s population. However, there are concerns about the sanitary conditions in which they were handled, as well as the damage done to stored equipment. NIH Director Dr. Mahmoud M. Abubakr said the agency was working to \u201cmake sure no samples are corrupted. \u201cEverything is clean at the moment,\u201d he said . \u201cBut we are keeping an eye on the situation to confirm this.\u201d\nSome of the samples are contiguous, but no samples with infectious diseases have affected those involved, he told Science Insider. \u201cNo such samples with a bacterial infection were detected in the samples in question,\u201d Abubakr said of their contamination or expiration. \u201cWe are also checking samples to ensure they don\u2019t have genetical problems.\u201d He assured that \u201csamples are safe\u201d. Apart from the safety issue, the NIH has also said that it has discovered 32 samples of DNA that could be mistaken for Ebola and has destroyed them. Some, however, were contaminated and some were of low quality and were discarded.\nSome samples could have been damaged during a fire in a laboratory, the director of the NIH said. The directorate is also investigating the laboratories in Khartoum to determine the scope of the damage and the number of damaged samples. \u201cWe don\u2019t yet know how many samples are not good \u2013 we have to take more time to investigate,\u201d he said. But the lab \u201cmay have lost something\u201d, added Dr. Taha. We need a full report from the NIH so that we don\u2019t lose any blood specimens. \u201cWe need to be careful with the samples,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to find the samples. \u201cAl-Bashir\u2019s departure from the NIW headquarters began a period of upheaval in Sudan. But the blood samples are a far bigger problem because they cannot be replaced.\nScientists and technicians say the loss of samples is a blow to scientific research and health care. NIH technicians can now only perform a limited number of clinical samples since the laboratory was looted in Khartoum. While many of the looted items could be obtained to resume work, their loss is non-negotiable. Samples cannot be replaced because the blood donors cannot be contacted. As a result, scientists lost most of the samples.

This survey was part of the programme and research activities of the Division of Communicable Disease Surveillance and Controls at the National Public Health Laboratory. The major aims of this programme were (i) to determine the incidence of certain communicable diseases throughout the Kingdom and to identify factors responsible for their occurrence, including surveillance for any new diseases which could be of public health significance, (ii) to develop methods of treatment and prophylaxis in communicable diseases and (iii) to facilitate laboratory facilities for diagnosis and research in communicable disease.

The response has been swift, with the Government of Sudan taking drastic measures to ensure the public\u2019s safety. This has included a ban on travel to and from certain countries, the establishment of quarantine zones, and the deployment of medical staff to work collaboratively to keep their citizens safe.\nThe global pandemic poses a major threat to global public health, and countries around the world must be prepared to respond quickly and effectively. This includes being prepared for emergency response, which is of utmost importance in times of crisis. Sudan has taken a proactive approach by establishing a National Public Health Emergency and taking appropriate measures to protect the public. This shows that Sudanese authorities are dedicated to protecting their citizens and ensuring their safety.\nIt is important that all governments worldwide take their own steps to ensure public safety, and this means that countries around the world must be prepared to respond in a timely and coordinated manner. Emergency response is an essential part of our global health and safety systems, and it is important that all governments take their own steps to ensure that this happens.\n2) How Will This Affect Global Health?\nOn April 26th, the government of Sudan declared a national public health emergency in an attempt to stop the spread of the coronavirus.

But they failed due to the solidarity and strength of character of the staff in Khartum. One month later, on 12th August, 2011, the management of the National Laboratory with the Minister of Health attempted to use force against the staff in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, when they wanted to keep working in the lab instead of submitting to the directives to leave. Staff in Dar es Salaam were also supported by colleagues in the Southern regions of Sudan and they resolved to remain in the lab until management and the authorities backed down. In both instances, the actions of the staff demonstrated their commitment and unshakable commitment to what is best for the people of Sudan.\nI had not known of such an occurrence until I was approached by an employee who had been to see his doctor in Khartum a few days after the 12th July with a sore head, severe abdominal pain, and an elevated temperature. It was a very hot day in Khartum and he was already feeling the temperature and humidity. His blood test results showed positive for all the viral illnesses which affect large parts of Sudan at this time of year. He was told he could wait for two more days as his samples were being processed. Unfortunately, it is not unusual in Sudan for there to be long delays before results are available from this laboratory, particularly due to the unprecedented pressure of testing. He had told me the story because I had talked to him about the staff at CIDRI and explained what was happening. He asked whether the CIDRI staff could assist the Sudanese staff. I assured him that we would look into this when we returned from the CIDRI workshop to be held in Johannesburg in September 2011.\nSouth Africa's public health laboratory was closed in 2009 as part of a policy of privatization implemented by the government. Instead, the work to test samples from South Africa was handled by specialists from several independent laboratories, who were sometimes located as far as 90km away from hospitals. This arrangement, the worst laboratory crisis in South Africa\u2019s history, resulted in samples being left at the hospital for extended periods before being taken to the laboratory, and in the case of positive results, samples were sometimes not conveyed to the relevant hospital because they had already been sent to a different hospital.\nIn June 2011, the President of South Africa initiated the process of restoring public laboratories as public services, and re-established the facilities in Pretoria and Durban.\nThese events in Sudan and South Africa have prompted many who work in public health laboratories to question the logic of privatization and the need to ensure quality in laboratory services by increasing professional standards.\nIn the Sudan, the laboratory staff have the right approach. They have responded to the needs of the people by deciding to act to improve testing services for the people of Sudan.\nThese events in Khartum and Dar es Salaam prove the importance of the CIDRI workshop in Johannesburg.

R. FUERNBAUER of the University of Alberta, Edmonton, established by far the largest of a series of experiments in which the effects of stressors were tested in the control of growth, mating and life history characteristics of certain species of Drosophila. Fuernbauer was examining the responses of fruit flies (the larvae of which eat fruits) when one of them inadvertently ingested a very high does of xylenes. In response to this novel stressor, the animal lost its ability to reproduce. It could not copulate and its ability to lay eggs was impaired. For five generations the animal's egg-laying ability was significantly reduced. It also had increased mortality and became smaller and more darkly colored. However, although this individual's progeny had lower than normal fertility, after a further generation they re-turned to their normal level of fertility. Fuernbauer then tested several other substances, in each case finding that effects in the same direction were produced. The effects were much smaller than that of the xylenes, however, and after one more generation the animals were as productive as their original counterparts. FIGURE SIX A female in a normal state - the male is approaching her. (Courtesy of the Journal of Comp. Physiol., Oxford) What effected the loss of fitness? Fuernbauer examined the growth rates and food-energy consumption of the animals. The result of the xylene-ingestion was that in the first generation those in the exposed group became significantly larger than those in the control group. This was because the individuals had taken up more foods to compensate for the higher rate of metabolism they had exhibited. This in turn led to a longer life cycle. They also produced young that were also bigger than those in the control group. After the ingestion of xylenes, these animals lived longer than the controls, but after a series of generations their lives became much shorter than those of the controls because they ate more food. Thus in their original state before they became stressed they were lean and active; however, after the novel challenge, they became obese and their normal activity dropped. Fuernbauer's experiments also examined growth rates in the second generation. He found that after a generation, many of the females had an enlarged body. (The males also show the stress effect but only one generation is examined.) When exposed to the xylenes these females grew significantly faster than the control females. The effects, although much smaller, were of the same nature as in the first generation. For example, those animals in the stressed group that were exposed to the highest doses of xylenes in their first generation displayed the most increased growth and the largest reduction in egg fertility.

As its name suggests, this new regulation creates a system of special protection for commercial secrets.\nA trade secret is one of the intangible assets whose value can be substantially increased via the implementation of adequate protection systems. The new Mexican regulation will grant the holder of a trade secret greater protection against the theft or misappropriation of the information and its use.\nAlthough there have been other protection mechanisms for the protection of trade secrets in Mexican law, such as the one provided in the Federal Law on Electronic Commerce and Transactions and Digital Innovation (also known as the Federal Law on Protection of Personal Data), which establishes the duty to adopt the security measures that are technically and operationally feasible, but are not sufficient.\nUnlike the system of protection established in the Federal Law on Intellectual Property, it is more comprehensive since it not only includes misappropriation, use and disclosure, but also includes theft. This type of protection goes much further and the new regulation also provides for the recovery and compensation of damages caused , in addition to its criminal nature.\nMexico\u2019s new Regulation will become effective on July 18, 2023. After that date, trade secrets protected under the Regulation will be subject to special protective rules that may be more aggressive than what is contained in current law.

This has been the result of almost 10 months of investigation into the events leading up to the accident, the accident itself and what action if any can be taken on the findings made.\nOn the morning of June 12, 2004, the C-47, registered 11087, departed Ottawa, ON. The pilot intended to fly to the UPA 726 Airshow at Oshawa, Ontario, where he would display at the airshow the C-47 for his sponsor.\nWhen over the shoreline at Belle River, the pilot, who was the sole occupant, experienced a right engine roughness which he attributed to a loss of oil pressure. He immediately conducted a low and fast loss of oil procedure, which was followed by a low and fast emergency descent. The fighter then impacted the water approximately one nautical mile north of the international bridge across the Detroit River. The aircraft was not recovered. The right wing and fuselage separated in the impact, and no one survived.\nThe Board is of the opinion that the probable cause of the accident was the failure of the right cylinder head to contain its compression gases from an undetermined event.\nThe Board is not able to determine in a more precise manner the proximate cause as it has not been possible to establish an exact cause of compression gases escaping the intake manifold of the right engine.\nPrior to flying the aircraft on the day of the accident, the pilot carried out a preflight inspection. However, his inspection checklist did not include engine checks. The pilot also failed to check the cooling system using the water temperature test.\nFurther, the pilot overrode aircraft diagnostics and followed the low and fast emergency procedure, contrary to the Pilot's Operating Handbook.\nLastly, the pilot's decisions and actions led him to fly the aircraft on a cross-country flight, at low altitude, in icing conditions, which was contrary to the flight restrictions that were in effect. He also flew the aircraft at an altitude inappropriate for recovering from an emergency.\nThe C-47 was operated after being modified with a modified exhaust to allow for its use on unleaded automotive fuel. While the Board is advised that the modifications were in compliance with TC requirements regarding the aircraft's weight and centre of gravity at the time it was modified and operated on unleaded automotive fuel, the operator failed to comply with the instructions contained in the Technical Advisory Circular regarding the weight and balance of the re-engineered aircraft.\nThe accident occurred 3 years and 10 months after Transport Canada published TC Engineering Bulletin E137-98A, Revision 4, titled \"C-47 Aircraft, Use of Avgas and Unleaded Automotive Gasoline\", which contained the following statement:\n\"Consider the impact that a significant change to the aircraft weight and balance at low and high airspeeds may have and the negative effect that this could have on safety of flight.\"\nThe operator failed to advise the Board that its modifications complied with the requirements in TC Engineering Bulletin E137-98A.\nIn the context of the C-47 re-engineering, TC EB E137-98A stated that the maximum allowable gross weight could only be changed in limited circumstances and, more specifically, if a certified aircraft mechanic deemed it necessary to ensure a safe operation based on inspection data. However, in this case, none of the documents provided to the Board indicated that a certified mechanic deemed any changes to the maximum allowable gross weight necessary.\nIn closing then, the Board concludes that the events leading up to the accident, including the modification and operation of the aircraft on unleaded automotive fuel, increased the level of risk to the C-47.\nThe Board is of the opinion that TC could have done more to promote safety, through a higher level of oversight that provided information to transportation safety officers and operators that would allow them to identify and address safety deficiencies in the operation of the C-47.\nThe TSB recommends that Transport Canada take measures to ensure that the modifications made by operators to C-47 aircraft do not result in a significant change of aircraft weight and balance when flown at low and high airspeed.\nTransport Canada (TC) has advised that, in 201", "output_2": "<s> On February 1, 2023 RAD, at the direction of the anadian Ministe of Natonal Deence, entered into an I nternational Ag reement with the United States of America on the transfer, tempora ry import, export, and exempt import of certain military articles and technology.\nThe purpose of this Agreement is to provide authority for the temporary transfer of such articles to the United States for the use or operational support of the Canadian Armed Forces overseas, in addition to temporary import, export, and exempt import authority for the export by United States Armed Forces and for the import of certain United States military articles and technology that are not currently listed on Canada's Military List or Munitions List.\nThe Agreement was signed on December 5, 2022 in Ottawa, ON by Canadian Ambassador to the United States Michael B.

The MRAPs are in excellent condition, and Canadian military engineers are currently en route to Ukraine to offer training and maintenance assistance. The MRAPs have been designed to protect drivers from enemy mines and explosives.\nMRAP, or mine-resistant ambush-protected, vehicles are designed to survive the most extreme terrain. Canadian MRAPs, constructed and developed by several companies, are the most up-to-date in the world.

The MRAP was designed to be impervious to roadside bombs and ambushes while the RG-33\u2019s protection is more comprehensive. The RG-33 also features a larger payload capacity, improved armour, and more powerful weaponry than the MRAP.
